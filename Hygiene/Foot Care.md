## Foot Wash

**Using a Footbath and Scrubber:**

- **Preparation:**
  - Choose a suitable footbath: You can use a dedicated footbath basin or even a large bowl.
  - Fill it with warm water: The temperature should be comfortable, not too hot. You can add Epsom salts, essential oils, or foot soak solutions for added relaxation and benefits.
  - Gather your tools: Have your foot scrubber (pumice stone, brush, or foot scrub mat), soap or foot cleanser, and a towel ready.
- **Soaking:**
  - Soak your feet in the warm water for 10-15 minutes. This softens the skin, making it easier to remove dead skin and calluses.
- **Scrubbing:**
  - Apply soap or foot cleanser to your feet.
  - Use the scrubber to gently exfoliate your feet. Pay extra attention to areas with rough skin, such as heels and the balls of your feet.
  - Scrub in gentle, circular motions. Avoid scrubbing too hard, as this can irritate the skin.
  - Be sure to clean between your toes.
- **Rinsing and Drying:**
  - Rinse your feet thoroughly with clean water to remove any soap and dead skin.
  - Dry your feet completely with a clean towel, especially between the toes. This helps prevent fungal infections.
- **Moisturizing:**
  - Apply a moisturizing foot cream or lotion to keep your feet soft and hydrated.

**Best Time of Day:**

- **Evening:**
  - Washing your feet in the evening can be very relaxing after a long day. It can help relieve tension and promote better sleep.
  - This is also a good time to apply a heavier moisturizer or foot cream, as it will have time to absorb overnight.
- **Morning:**
  - Washing your feet in the morning can be a refreshing way to start your day.
  - If you tend to have sweaty feet, a morning wash can help keep them feeling fresh.
- **Spacing it from the Shower:**
  - The key is to create a separate ritual. Choosing a time that is not directly before or after your shower will help create this seperation.
  - Perhaps after dinner, while watching television, or before bed.

**Important Considerations:**

- **Hygiene:** Keep your footbath and scrubber clean to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi.
- **Skin Sensitivity:** If you have sensitive skin, use a mild soap or foot cleanser and avoid harsh scrubbing.
- **Medical Conditions:** If you have diabetes or other medical conditions that affect your feet, consult with your doctor before using a footbath or scrubber.

### Rub feet epsom salt

### expiration date

The lifespan of PROcure Science+Nature Epsom Salt Rub Gel isn't tied to a strict expiration date because Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate), its primary active ingredient, is a stable mineral compound that doesn't naturally degrade or spoil over time under normal conditions. Unlike organic products, it doesn't support microbial growth or break down chemically, so it can theoretically last indefinitely if stored properly. However, practical usability depends on a few factors specific to this gel formulation.
The product itself---a 6 oz tube---doesn't list an expiration date on its packaging, which aligns with Epsom salt's inherent longevity. That said, it's not just Epsom salt; it's a gel with additional ingredients like aloe vera, glycerin, essential oils (e.g., wintergreen, tea tree, lavender), and water. These components can influence shelf life:

-   Aloe vera and water: These introduce moisture, which could potentially allow mold or bacteria to grow if the tube is contaminated (e.g., by dirty hands) or improperly sealed. The preservatives (phenoxyethanol, caprylyl glycol) are there to prevent this, and they're typically effective for 2-3 years in cosmetics.

-   Essential oils: These can oxidize or lose potency over time, especially if exposed to air, heat, or light, but this would only affect fragrance or minor soothing effects, not the core Epsom salt function.

-   Gel consistency: The xanthan gum and other stabilizers might break down after several years, making the texture less appealing (e.g., watery or clumpy), but this doesn't mean it's unsafe or ineffective.

User reviews on platforms like Amazon suggest it remains effective for years. Some report using tubes purchased 2+ years ago with no loss in muscle-soothing ability, as long as it's still a gel and not visibly spoiled (e.g., no odd smell, color change, or mold). PROcure's FAQ doesn't specify a shelf life, but they note 50+ applications per tube, implying it's designed to last a while with occasional use.
For a definitive lifespan: If unopened and stored in a cool, dry place (away from humidity or extreme heat), it's likely good for 3-5 years or more, based on typical cosmetic preservative efficacy and Epsom salt's stability. Once opened, aim to use it within 1-2 years for optimal quality, though it could still work beyond that if it looks and smells fine. Check for off odors, separation, or discoloration as signs it's past its prime---though these are rare with proper storage.
So, practically speaking, your 15-year-old glasses might outlast a tube's ideal condition, but the Epsom salt gel itself doesn't "expire" in a traditional sense. Have you noticed any changes in your tube's texture or smell yet? That'd give a clue if it's still kicking.
