## How to Use a Water Flosser

* Doesnâ€™t last forever just like toothbrush

Based on the provided search results, here's a comprehensive guide on how to use water flossers:

**Step-by-Step Instructions**

1. **Fill the reservoir**: Fill the water reservoir with lukewarm water. You can also add a bit of mouthwash if desired.
2. **Choose a tip**: Select the appropriate tip for your water flosser, depending on your oral health needs (e.g., for braces, gum pockets, or implants).
3. **Place the tip**: Lean over the sink and place the tip in your mouth, aiming it at a 90-degree angle along the gumline.
4. **Turn it on**: Turn on the water flow, starting with the lowest pressure setting and adjusting as needed.
5. **Floss**: Move the tip along the gumline, tracing the outline of each tooth. Focus on the top of the teeth, gum line, and spaces between each tooth.
6. **Work your way around**: Start at the back of your mouth and work your way forward, cleaning all areas thoroughly.
7. **Empty the reservoir**: After use, empty any remaining water from the reservoir to prevent bacterial growth.

**Additional Tips**

* Use a gentle touch and avoid forcing the tip between teeth.
* Use the pause or on/off switch to stop water flow if needed.
* For best results, use a water flosser before brushing and flossing to loosen food particles and plaque.
* Clean your water flosser regularly (every 1-3 months) by rinsing with warm soapy water and soaking the tips in white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide.

**Model-Specific Instructions**

* Oral-B Water Flosser: Follow the same steps above. Note that some models may have an in-handle pause or on/off switch.
* Waterpik Water Flosser: Fill the reservoir with lukewarm water, click a tip into the handle, lean over the sink, and place the tip in your mouth. Turn the unit on, aim the tip along your gumline, and let water flow from your mouth into the sink.

**Benefits and Precautions**

* Water flossers are gentle on gums and can be especially helpful for those with sensitive gums or difficulty using traditional floss.
* They can remove more plaque and food debris than traditional flossing alone.
* Regular use can improve gum health and reduce inflammation.
* Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for your specific water flosser model.

Remember to consult your dentist or oral healthcare professional if you have any questions or concerns about using a water flosser or maintaining good oral hygiene practices.

## Hygiene Best Practices

* Brush your teeth twice a day with a toothpaste.
* Floss once a day to remove plaque and food particles from between your teeth.
* Rinse your mouth with an antibacterial mouthwash.
* See your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings.
* Eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
* Limit your intake of sugary foods and drinks.
* Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to avoid damaging your gums.
* Replace your toothbrush every three months.
* Consider using a tongue scraper to remove bacteria from your tongue.
* Drink plenty of water to help keep your mouth moist.

## AVOID

Toxic Toothpaste Ingredients to Avoid

1. **Titanium Dioxide**: Classified as a possible carcinogen by the Environmental Working Group (EWG). It's added as a colorant to make toothpaste white, but doesn't provide any oral benefits.
2. **Triclosan**: Linked to endocrine (hormone) disruption and potential carcinogenicity. It's an antibacterial agent used in some toothpastes, but its use has been largely discontinued due to health concerns.
3. **Hydrogen Peroxide**: While safe in small concentrations, excessive use can lead to enamel damage and tooth sensitivity.

### Toothpastes with Triclosan

Based on the provided search results, the following toothpaste uses triclosan:

* Colgate Total toothpaste (pre-2022 formulation): According to the 2016 New York Times article and the 2023 publication, Colgate Total toothpaste contained triclosan as its active ingredient until its reformulation in 2022.
* Colgate Total toothpaste (pre-2022 formulation, specific details): The 2023 publication and the 2022 PMC article mention that Colgate Total toothpaste contained 10 mM triclosan, an anti-bacterial agent, along with a copolymer that retained the triclosan on the tooth surface for up to 12 hours.

Please note that Colgate has since reformulated Colgate Total toothpaste to remove triclosan, as reported in the 2022 article. The current formulation uses stannous fluoride as the active ingredient instead.

**Organic Alternatives:**

1. **Hydroxyapatite (HAp) Toothpaste**: A natural, non-toxic alternative for preventing tooth decay and rebuilding tooth structure. Look for brands like Boka, which uses HAp as a primary ingredient.
2. **Natural Whitening Agents**: Instead of hydrogen peroxide, some toothpastes use natural whitening agents like baking soda, essential oils (e.g., tea tree oil), or plant-based extracts (e.g., chamomile).

**How to Avoid Carcinogenic Ingredients:**

1. **Read Labels**: Check the ingredient list for titanium dioxide, triclosan, and hydrogen peroxide. Opt for toothpastes with natural, organic ingredients.
2. **Choose EU Ecolabel Products**: The EU Ecolabel certification ensures products meet certain environmental standards, including the avoidance of harmful chemicals like triclosan and parabens.
3. **Support Brands with Transparent Ingredients**: Look for companies that disclose their ingredients and manufacturing processes. This can help you make informed decisions about the products you use.
4. **Consult with Your Dentist**: If you're concerned about the ingredients in your toothpaste, consult with your dentist or hygienist for personalized recommendations.

Remember to always prioritize your oral health and well-being by choosing natural, non-toxic products and consulting with a healthcare professional if you have any concerns.
