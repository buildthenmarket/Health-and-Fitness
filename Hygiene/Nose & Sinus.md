# Using Air Purifier and Humidifier to Help with Dry Nose

Dry nose can be uncomfortable and may lead to irritation or nosebleeds. Two effective devices to help alleviate dry nose symptoms are air purifiers and humidifiers.

## Air Purifier

- **Purpose:** Removes dust, allergens, and pollutants from the air.
- **Benefit:** Cleaner air reduces nasal irritation and prevents further dryness caused by airborne particles.
- **Tip:** Choose a purifier with a HEPA filter for best results.

## Humidifier

- **Purpose:** Adds moisture to the air, increasing humidity levels.
- **Benefit:** Moist air soothes nasal passages and prevents them from drying out.
- **Tip:** Maintain indoor humidity between 30% and 50% for optimal comfort.

## Usage Tips

- Place both devices in your bedroom or main living area.
- Clean and maintain devices regularly to prevent mold and bacteria buildup.
- Monitor humidity levels with a hygrometer.

By combining an air purifier and a humidifier, you can create a healthier indoor environment and relieve dry nose symptoms effectively.
