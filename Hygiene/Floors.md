# Floor cleaning routine

**Daily:**

* **Quick sweep:** Use your wireless vacuum to quickly pick up any visible dirt, crumbs, or pet hair. Focus on high-traffic areas like the kitchen, living room, and entryways.

**Weekly:**

* **Thorough vacuuming:** Give your entire apartment a thorough vacuuming, paying close attention to corners, under furniture, and along baseboards.
* **Swiffer mop:** Use a Swiffer wet mop with a cleaning solution appropriate for your floor type to clean the entire floor.

**Monthly:**

* **Deep clean:** For a deeper clean, you can use a stronger cleaning solution with your Swiffer mop. Focus on areas with heavy foot traffic or spills.

**Additional tips:**

* **Regularly empty the dust bin:** Empty your wireless vacuum's dust bin after each use to maintain suction power.
* **Replace Swiffer pads:** Replace Swiffer pads regularly to ensure effective cleaning.
* **Spot clean spills immediately:** Don't let spills sit for too long, as they can stain your floors. Wipe them up immediately with a damp cloth or use your Swiffer wet mop.

By following this routine, you can keep your hard floors clean and looking their best with minimal effort!
