Habits are learned behaviors that become automatic over time. They involve a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding the habit loop can help us break bad habits and form new, positive ones.

## "we do not rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems.”

Within our self-imposed systems, our execution is also capped at our love level.

Whether you love your job, have fallen out of love with it, or have never loved it all, the work to sustain it, find our way back, or find the job that we do love, is key to both success and happiness.

## Identify Bad Habit

- disrupt the normal routine, you will get focus

**It takes three steps to identify and break a bad habit:**

1. **Cue:** When, where, with whom, or after which activity do you feel the urge for your habit?
2. **Reward:** What craving are you trying to satisfy?
3. **Routine:** Can you train yourself to do something else that satisfies the same need?

1.  **Small acts of kindness can change someone's entire day.** Consider going out of your way to give genuine compliments, words of affirmation, or expressions of gratitude. These thoughtful gestures can lift others' spirits and brighten their perspective.

2.  **Change comes from daily, focused effort over time.** Try to carve out dedicated time daily to chip away at your goals. Small, consistent efforts can compound over the long run into remarkable results. Maintaining discipline and patience creates tangible progress.

3.  **Progress beats perfection every time.** Focus on consistent, incremental improvements rather than seeking flawless results right away. This allows you to build gradually towards excellence with self-compassion.

4.  **True intimacy requires courage and vulnerability from both people.** Invest time strengthening communication in your closest relationships by openly sharing thoughts and feelings. This emotional availability can help bonds grow exponentially deeper.

5.  **Listening is just as important as speaking up.** Strive to be fully present with someone by making eye contact, asking thoughtful questions, and avoiding interruptions. This makes them feel truly heard and builds mutual understanding.

6.  **Saying "no" gives you space to say "yes" to what matters most.** Practice declining commitments gracefully to free up availability for aligning time with your purpose and passions.

7.  **Money comes and goes, but time is our most precious resource.** Take inventory of how you spend hours and minutes. Eliminate time drains, and align schedule with energizing activities.

8.  **Doubt signifies areas for growth.** Reframe doubts as exciting opportunities to expand your comfort zone and capabilities.

9.  **Be intentional about resting and recharging.** I've found good sleep, walking and going to the gym reenergizes both the body and mind. Integrate regular movement breaks as an invaluable reset for mood, focus and creativity.

10.  **Your core values can guide your best decisions.** Reference principles and ethics when facing difficult dilemmas to discern optimal choices aligned with your highest good.

11.  **Reading deeply feeds the soul more than skimming widely.** Savor thought-provoking books by absorbing them slowly rather than rushing. This immersive process reveals profound insights to ponder afterwards.

12.  **Healthy friction from intellectual sparring partners helps you question assumptions and motivates you to improve.** Seek out relationships with those of differing worldviews to strengthen your reasoning by debating respectfully.

13.  **An abundance mindset opens you up to more opportunities.** Practice feeling genuine happiness for others' successes to dissolve unconscious scarcity fears through the law of attraction.

14.  **Luck happens more often for those who show up consistently with focused effort and intention.** Double down on diligent habits and processes to compound positive results exponentially.

15.  **Your worth isn't defined by fleeting status symbols or busy schedules.** Celebrate intrinsic rewards like rest, relationships and personal growth over external validation.

16.  **Move your gauge of success squarely into dimensions you can directly influence (i.e. focus on what you can control).** This gave me a greater sense of control and empowerment. Judge yourself by metrics within your control rather than comparing to others. This builds agency.

17.  **Not having an opinion on something unfamiliar is wise.** Get comfortable saying "I don't know enough yet" with humble honesty rather than guessing. This allows non-defensive learning later.

18.  **Feedback reflecting lack of awareness provides a gift of clarity.** Express gratitude for critique revealing blind spots, rather than getting defensive. This allows for improvement.

19.  **Progress requires patience with yourself and others alike.** Lead with compassion - we're all doing our best with current awareness. This grace allows learning without shame.

20.  **Joy is found through courage, not control.** Step outside comfort zones, where the magic happens. Each leap builds confidence and reveals new depths within.

21.  **Learning never stops; complacency is the enemy of achievement.** Expose yourself continuously to novel ideas to stay curious and reach your potential.

22.  **No experience is ever wasted, as everything offers self-discovery if you pay attention.** Embrace painful endings mindfully as portals offering spiritual nutrition full of lessons.

23.  **Good enough may open the road to greatness down the line.** Forgive yourself for reasonable imperfection to ease overwhelm, building energy for your bigger vision.
