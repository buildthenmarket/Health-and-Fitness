1. Cut oxidative stress

Processed food, sleep deprivation, and chronic stress all flood your body with free radicals.

These damage melanocytes and destroy pigment.

Avoid:
• Seed oils
• Excess alcohol
• Late-night blue light

It’s a cellular malfunction, a red flag that your body is under attack from the inside.

Fix that, and your pigment can return.

Your hair color comes from melanocytes, pigment-producing cells in your follicles.

But melanocytes don’t just color your hair.

They’re also part of your immune system.

When they break down, your body isn't just losing pigment, it’s losing protection.

2. Support catalase production

Hydrogen peroxide builds up in your scalp and bleaches your hair from the inside.

Catalase breaks it down, but levels drop with age.

Eat more:
• Broccoli • Garlic • Onions • Moringa

3. Boost copper

Copper activates tyrosinase, the enzyme that triggers melanin production.

Great sources:
• Liver
• Cashews
• Chickpeas
• Dark chocolate
• Moringa

4. Don’t ignore methylation

Poor methylation slows detox and weakens hair follicles.

You need:
• Folate (leafy greens)
• B12 (eggs, meat)
• Choline (egg yolks)

5. Lower cortisol

Chronic stress increases hydrogen peroxide in the scalp.

To lower cortisol:
• Get morning sun
• Breathe through your nose
• Walk after meals
• Ditch caffeine after noon

6. Check your thyroid

Low thyroid function is often missed but it’s linked to early greying.

Watch for:
• Cold hands and feet
• Fatigue
• Mood swings
• Dry skin

Ask for TSH, Free T3, and Free T4, not just "normal" labs, see this video:

## Split Ends in Hair

Split ends, scientifically known as trichoptilosis, occur when the hair shaft splits into one or two parts, primarily at the end of the shaft. This condition is a common problem in hair care and can be caused by various factors, both external and internal.

### Common Causes of Split Ends

1. **Mechanical Damage**: Aggressive brushing, especially when hair is wet, can cause physical stress leading to split ends.
2. **Heat Styling**: Frequent use of hot tools like flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers can weaken and damage the hair cuticle.
3. **Chemical Treatments**: Hair dyes, perms, and relaxers can compromise the integrity of the hair cuticle.
4. **Environmental Factors**: Exposure to the sun, wind, and dry air can erode the cuticle over time.
5. **Nutritional Deficiencies**: Lack of proper nutrition can weaken hair, making it more susceptible to splitting.

### Why Split Ends Are a Problem

Split ends are problematic because they indicate damage to the hair shaft. Once a split occurs, it cannot be repaired, and the damage can spread up the hair shaft, leading to further breakage. This can result in shorter hair, a frizzy appearance, and a generally unhealthy look. Additionally, split ends can make hair more prone to breakage, which can contribute to hair loss and thinning.

### How to Fix Split Ends

The only reliable way to get rid of split ends is to cut them off. However, there are ways to manage and prevent them:

- **Regular Trims**: Getting regular haircuts can help remove split ends before they spread.
- **Gentle Handling**: Avoid brushing hair too aggressively, especially when it's wet, and use a wide-toothed comb to minimize breakage.
- **Proper Hair Care**: Use moisturizing and conditioning products to keep hair hydrated and protected.
- **Limit Heat Styling**: Reduce the use of heat tools or use heat protectants when styling.
- **Avoid Chemical Treatments**: Minimize the use of harsh chemical treatments and opt for gentler alternatives when possible.
- **Protect from Environmental Damage**: Use hair products that protect against sun and wind damage, and consider wearing a hat or scarf in harsh weather conditions.

In summary, split ends are a common issue in hair care that can be caused by various factors, including mechanical damage, heat styling, chemical treatments, and environmental exposure. They are problematic because they indicate damage to the hair shaft and can lead to further breakage. The best way to address split ends is through regular trims and gentle hair care practices.
