Cancer cells don't "activate" nagalase; rather, they produce and secrete it. Nagalase, also known as alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, is a naturally occurring enzyme in the body, but it is typically found inside cells. In cancer, a significant amount of this enzyme is secreted by malignant cells into the bloodstream.

This overproduction of nagalase is a key part of how cancer cells can evade the immune system. Here's how it works:

1.  **Nagalase and the Gc protein:** The body has a protein called the Gc protein (also known as vitamin D-binding protein). This protein is the precursor for a crucial immune system molecule called GcMAF (Gc protein-derived macrophage-activating factor).

2.  **GcMAF's Role:** GcMAF is essential for activating macrophages, which are a type of white blood cell that acts as a "scavenger" of the immune system. Macrophages are responsible for identifying and destroying foreign invaders, like bacteria and viruses, as well as abnormal cells, including cancer cells.

3.  **The Cancer Cell's Strategy:** The nagalase enzyme secreted by cancer cells has a specific function: it "deglycosylates" or removes sugar molecules from the Gc protein. This action prevents the Gc protein from being converted into its active form, GcMAF.

4.  **Immune System Suppression:** By inhibiting the formation of GcMAF, nagalase effectively suppresses the activation of macrophages. This leaves the immune system's primary defense mechanism against abnormal cells significantly weakened, allowing the cancer cells to grow and spread without being detected and destroyed.

Because of this mechanism, the presence of elevated nagalase levels in the blood is often considered a biomarker for the presence and aggressiveness of cancer. It's a way for doctors to monitor the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of certain treatments, as a decrease in nagalase levels can correlate with a reduction in tumor size.
