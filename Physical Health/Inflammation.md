## Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP)

- acute (recent or early on)

High Sensitivity CRP Diet Impact

Highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is a marker of inflammation in the body and is used to assess the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Elevated levels of hsCRP indicate a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and sudden cardiac death, even in people without a history of cardiovascular disease. The hsCRP test is particularly useful for individuals who have a moderate risk of heart attack within the next 10 years, based on factors such as lifestyle, family history, and current health status.

The hsCRP levels are categorized as follows:

- Less than 1 mg/L: Low risk
- 1 to 3 mg/L: Moderate risk
- Greater than 3 mg/L: High risk

To reduce hsCRP levels, you can adopt a heart-healthy diet and lifestyle changes. Here are some dietary recommendations:

- **Increase intake of whole grains**: These are rich in fiber and can help lower cholesterol levels.
- **Eat more fruits and vegetables**: They are naturally low in salt and sugar and can provide essential nutrients and antioxidants.
- **Choose lean protein sources**: Opt for beans/legumes, fish, white poultry, egg whites, and nonfat dairy foods.
- **Limit processed foods and sugars**: These can contribute to inflammation and high blood glucose levels.
- **Reduce red meat and full-fat dairy products**: These can increase cholesterol levels and contribute to inflammation.

Additionally, regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, and managing stress can also help lower hsCRP levels. If your hsCRP levels remain high, your doctor may recommend additional interventions, such as taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin or statins.
