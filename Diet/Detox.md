* **Flavonoids**: Cinnamon is rich in flavonoids, which are a type of polyphenol. These compounds have strong antioxidant properties and can help reduce the risk of chronic diseases by neutralizing free radicals. Flavonoids in cinnamon include quercetin, kaempferol, and myricetin.

* **Polyphenols**: Cinnamon is packed with various polyphenols, which are powerful antioxidants. These compounds help neutralize harmful free radicals in the body and prevent oxidative stress. They can also improve blood sugar control, reduce inflammation, and protect against heart disease and cancer.

* **Eugenol**: This is another bioactive compound found in cinnamon, known for its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties. It can help reduce pain and inflammation in the body.

* **Cinnamtannin B1**: This compound is known for its strong antioxidant properties and can help protect the body from oxidative stress and damage.

These compounds collectively contribute to cinnamon's wide range of health benefits, including its ability to improve blood sugar control, reduce inflammation, and protect against chronic diseases.

## Health Benefits of Honey Compounds

Honey contains a variety of bioactive compounds including antioxidants, flavonoids, and polyphenols, each with distinct health benefits:

* **Chrysin**: This compound has a molecular formula of $C_{15}H_{10}O_{4}$. It is known for its potential to improve cognitive deficits and brain damage, and it also exhibits anticancer properties.
