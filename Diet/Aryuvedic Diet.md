### Avoidance of Root Vegetables and Alliaceous Plants

1. **Root Vegetables**: Root vegetables like potatoes, yams, and beets are generally not considered sattvic because they are believed to be heavy and grounding, which can disrupt the body's balance. However, this is a matter of interpretation and not all Ayurvedic practitioners agree on this point. Some may include root vegetables in moderation as part of a balanced diet.

2. **Alliaceous Plants**: Alliaceous plants, which include onions and garlic, are often avoided in sattvic diets because they are considered rajasic or tamasic, meaning they can cause agitation and dullness. These plants are believed to have strong heating properties and can disrupt the body's natural balance, leading to digestive issues and other health problems.

## Sattvic Vitamin D Foods

The Sattvic diet, which is based on Ayurvedic principles, emphasizes whole, nutritious foods and excludes certain items like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and some plant-based foods such as garlic and onions. While the diet is rich in nutrient-dense foods, it does not include many common sources of vitamin D.

However, there are a few foods that are allowed in the Sattvic diet and can provide some vitamin D:

* **Cow's milk**: Fortified cow's milk can be a good source of vitamin D. One cup of 2% milkfat fortified with vitamin D contains about 120 IU (International Units) of vitamin D, which is approximately 15% of the Daily Value (DV).
* **Soy, almond, and oat milks**: These plant-based milks are often fortified with vitamin D. One cup typically contains 100-144 IU of vitamin D, which is about 13-18% of the DV.
* **Fortified ready-to-eat cereals**: A serving of cereal fortified with 10% of the DV for vitamin D can provide about 80 IU of vitamin D, which is 10% of the DV.

It's important to note that the primary sources of vitamin D are fatty fish, fish liver oils, beef liver, and egg yolks, which are not included in the Sattvic diet. Therefore, individuals following the Sattvic diet may need to consider vitamin D supplements or ensure they are getting enough sunlight to meet their vitamin D requirements.
