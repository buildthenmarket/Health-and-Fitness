25 organic pesticides are approved for organic use versus the staggering 900 that are currently allowed to be used on conventional crops ([15](https://ota.com/advocacy/organic-standards/national-list-allowed-and-prohibited-substances)).

organic pesticides are tightly regulated for safety but can be harmful to health in high doses. organic pesticides, such as copper, rotenone and spinosad, can be used in organic farming. Unfortunately, long-term studies examining the risks of consuming conventional fruits and vegetables versus organic fruits and vegetables in the general population are lacking.

## Vegetarian Protein

- Seitan: The plant protein with the highest amount of protein per serving is seitan. Boasting 31 grams of protein per 3 oz portion, it also contains 6x more amino acids than other grains.
- Quinoa: While quinoa only contains 8 grams of protein per 1 cup serving, it contains much higher amounts of most amino acids than other seeds.
- Spirulina: also known as blue-green algae, spirulina contains 4-8 grams of protein in only 2 tablespoons, making the perfect addition to smoothies. It is also a great source of iron.
- Hemp Seeds: Another food with high amounts of protein in a small package are hemp seeds. They contain 6 grams of protein in 2 tablespoons and are also very high in most amino acids.
- Tofu and Tempeh: tofu and tempeh are made from soybeans and can provide 10-15 grams protein in a half-cup serving. Both contain adequate amounts of all amino acids, therefore are considered a complete protein.
- Lentils: for a half-cup serving, lentils provide 9 grams of protein and provide adequate amounts of each amino acid except tryptophan.  
- Pumpkin Seeds: contain 9 grams of protein for a quarter-cup serving. Pumpkin seeds appear to be the only seed with adequate levels of tryptophan.

## Fruits

### Cucumbers

Cucumbers are classified as a **vegetable** in the culinary world. However, botanically, they are considered **fruits** because they grow from the flower of a plant and contain seeds.

While cucumbers don't contain specific "weight loss" nutrients, their unique combination of properties makes them a great addition to a weight loss diet:

**High Water Content:**

- **Hydration:** Cucumbers are 96% water, which helps keep you hydrated and can contribute to feelings of fullness.
- **Low-Calorie Density:** Their high water content means they're low in calories, making them a satisfying and low-calorie snack.

**Fiber:**

- **Digestive Health:** Fiber promotes healthy digestion and can help regulate bowel movements.
- **Appetite Control:** Fiber can help you feel fuller for longer, reducing overall calorie intake.

**Vitamins and Minerals:**

- **Essential Nutrients:** Cucumbers provide essential vitamins like vitamin K and minerals like potassium, which support overall health.

**Overall, cucumbers are a low-calorie, hydrating, and nutrient-dense food that can support weight loss as part of a balanced diet.**

It's important to note that no single food is a magic solution for weight loss. A healthy and sustainable weight loss plan involves a combination of factors, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep. Cucumbers can be a valuable part of this plan, but they should be combined with other healthy foods and lifestyle practices.

## US Bananas vs Global Size

The size of bananas sold in the United States is generally larger compared to those in other countries due to specific cultivation and selection practices. In the U.S., the Cavendish variety, which is the most commonly traded banana, is grown to meet consumer preferences for larger fruit. This variety is selected and bred for size, sweetness, and shelf life to suit the U.S. market demands. Additionally, the bananas are picked green and ripened artificially using ethylene gas, which can influence their size and appearance. However, it's important to note that the perception of larger bananas in the U.S. may also be influenced by the availability of different varieties and sizes in other countries, where smaller or differently shaped bananas are more common.

## Lion's Mane Cognitive Benefits

Lion's mane mushroom (Hericium erinaceus) is believed to offer cognitive benefits due to its potential to enhance brain cell growth and improve memory. Research has shown that compounds found in lion's mane mushrooms, such as N-de phenylethyl isohericerin (NDPIH) and hericene A, may stimulate the growth of neurons and help form new connections in the brain, which could lead to improved cognitive function and memory

Studies have indicated that lion's mane supplementation might help normalize changes in behavior often triggered by high stress, such as loss of appetite, nervous behaviors, and procrastination Additionally, some research suggests that lion's mane may have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help with stress and work as an antidepressant

While these findings are promising, it is important to note that most studies on the benefits of lion's mane have been conducted on animals, and more research in humans is needed to validate these findings Lion's mane mushrooms are generally considered safe unless you are allergic to mushrooms

Dosage recommendations can vary based on individual factors like age and overall health. For improving cognition, some researchers recommend 3 to 5 grams per day In a 2020 study, people ages 50 and older with mild Alzheimer's disease symptoms showed significantly improved cognitive function after taking three 350-mg lion's mane capsules daily for 49 weeks Another study from 2019 found that taking three 400-mg capsules daily for 8 weeks helped relieve depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders for 77 people who were overweight or had obesity

In summary, while lion's mane mushroom shows potential for cognitive benefits, more human studies are needed to fully understand its effects and optimal usage

## Science of Yacon Benefits

Yacon, scientifically known as Smallanthus sonchifolius, is a root vegetable native to the Andean regions of South America. It is rich in fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and inulin, which are types of carbohydrates that are not digested by the body but instead act as prebiotics in the gut, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus

The prebiotic properties of FOS in yacon can improve gut microflora by acting as a food source for good bacteria in the large intestine, which can enhance digestive health and support the immune system  Additionally, FOS can reduce the pH levels in the large intestine, which helps the body absorb minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus

Yacon is also beneficial for blood sugar regulation due to its low glycemic index. The fructooligosaccharides and inulin in yacon prevent the absorption of simple sugars in the small intestine, potentially lowering glucose production in the liver and fasting glucose rates  This makes yacon a suitable dietary choice for individuals with diabetes or those looking to manage their blood sugar levels

Furthermore, yacon has been shown to aid in weight loss and suppress appetite, possibly due to its high fiber content and low caloric value  Studies have indicated that yacon syrup can promote weight loss and reduce insulin resistance, which may help in managing obesity

Yacon also offers potential cardiovascular benefits, as it contains potassium, which helps balance sodium levels in the body and maintain healthy blood pressure levels  This can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke, particularly for individuals with hypertension

In summary, the scientific benefits of yacon are rooted in its unique composition of FOS and inulin, which support digestive health, blood sugar regulation, weight management, and cardiovascular health
