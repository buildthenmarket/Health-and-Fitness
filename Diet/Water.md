## Reverse Osmosis

Reverse osmosis is a water purification process that uses a semipermeable membrane to remove impurities from water. The process involves pushing water through a membrane that filters out contaminants like lead, asbestos, and other dissolved solids, providing highly purified water. For rental apartments, countertop reverse osmosis systems are a practical option as they do not require installation and can be easily plugged into a faucet. These systems are compact and efficient, producing purified water without the need to modify the apartment's plumbing. Additionally, portable reverse osmosis systems like the Zip can be used, offering a plug-and-play solution that adds minerals back into the water to balance pH levels.
