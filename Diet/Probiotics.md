## Manuka Honey Probiotic Evidence

Based on the provided search results, here are the key findings on the benefits of Manuka honey probiotic enzyme:

**Enhanced Probiotic Growth**: Manuka honey contains oligosaccharides, acting as prebiotics, which enhance probiotic growth, improving gut health (Entity 1: Probiotic Support).

**Increased Probiotic Counts**: Adding Manuka honey to probiotic-rich yogurt increases probiotic counts, boosting digestive wellness (Entity 2: Combination with Yogurt).

**Supports Microbial Diversity**: Manuka honey's prebiotic content supports microbial diversity, enhancing immune function and nutrient absorption (Entity 3: Gut Microbiome Diversity).

**Improves Digestion and Resists Harmful Bacteria**: Manuka honey feeds beneficial gut bacteria, improving digestion, resisting harmful bacteria, and enhancing overall wellness (Entity 4: Role in Digestive Health).

**Antibacterial and Anti-Inflammatory Properties**: Manuka honey exhibits antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Helicobacter pylori, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it effective in eradicating over 50 species of harmful bacteria, including those targeting the digestive system (Entity 5: Anti-Inflammatory and Antibacterial Activity).

**Prevents Bacterial Overgrowth and Improves Immune Systems**: Manuka honey's probiotic activity prevents bacterial overgrowth and undesirable pathogens, while also helping to improve immune systems, intestinal infections, and stool quality (Entity 6: Manuka Honey for Gut Health).

**Promotes Healthy Gut Biome**: Manuka honey is effective in promoting a healthy, balanced microbiome, which keeps the body feeling its best and helps protect against disease (Entity 7: The Power of Manuka Honey for Digestive Health).

These findings collectively demonstrate the benefits of Manuka honey probiotic enzyme in supporting gut health, promoting probiotic growth, and enhancing overall digestive wellness.

### Manuka Honey in Hot Coffee Effects

Based on the provided search results, here are the key findings:

1. **Temperature sensitivity**: Manuka honey contains enzymes that are naturally occurring bio-ingredients giving it its antibacterial properties. These enzymes are destroyed by heat or prolonged exposure to high temperatures (Kwakman et al., 2010; Ferguson et al., 1998; Lu et al., 2013).
2. **Heat destruction**: The recommended temperature for consuming manuka honey is below 47°C (116°F), as high sustained heat can destroy the methylglyoxal (MGO) associated with antibacterial activity (Lu et al., 2013). Boiling water (60-100°C or 140-212°F) can completely destroy these enzymes.
3. **Loss of bio-benefits**: Mixing manuka honey in hot water, tea, coffee, or baking is not advisable, as it will destroy the enzymes and diminish the bio-benefits of manuka honey (Manuka Honey in Hot Water, Tea, Coffee. Heat-sensitive., 2019).
4. **Preservation of enzymes**: To preserve the enzymes and bio-benefits, it is recommended to consume manuka honey raw, without heating or prolonged exposure to high temperatures (Manuka Honey in Hot Water, Tea, Coffee. Heat-sensitive., 2019).

In summary, the evidence suggests that putting manuka honey into hot coffee can ruin its probiotic enzyme benefits due to the destruction of the enzymes by high heat. To maintain the bio-benefits, it is recommended to consume manuka honey raw, at a temperature below 47°C (116°F).

## Traveling to countries with bad sanitation

When traveling, especially to places with different sanitation standards, it's important to maintain gut health and support digestion. Here are some over-the-counter (OTC) solutions that can help manage digestive issues caused by unfamiliar or potentially contaminated foods:

* **Gut Enzymes**: These supplements help break down food more effectively, which can be particularly useful when eating unfamiliar foods. They can reduce bloating, gas, and other digestive discomforts. For instance, you might take them during meals to aid in the digestion of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

* **Probiotics**: Probiotic supplements, such as Culturelle or Florastor, are beneficial for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. They can help prevent digestive issues like traveler's diarrhea by supporting the balance of good bacteria in your gut. Probiotics are especially useful when you're exposed to new environments and different types of bacteria.

Both gut enzymes and probiotics can be taken as part of a travel health kit to help manage digestive issues and maintain overall gut health while traveling.
