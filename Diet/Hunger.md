# Hunger hormone

- hunger 48hrs
- it affects your sleep/wake cycle, reward-seeking behavior, taste sensation, and carbohydrate metabolism
- people with obesity may have an overly active ghrelin receptor, known as GHS-R, which leads to increased calorie intake

Obese subjects do not exhibit the decline in plasma ghrelin and leptin seen after a meal in the lean. The role of the decline in leptin is unclear but given the orexigenic properties of ghrelin, the lack of suppression following a meal in obese subjects could lead to increased food consumption and suggest that ghrelin may be involved in the pathophysiology of obesity.

## Ghrelin

### Ghrelin, the "hunger hormone," can interact with the pleasure and reward system in the brain, making us crave certain foods more than others. Here's how it works:

- Ghrelin's Job: Ghrelin increases appetite in general, but it also interacts with dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward.
- Dopamine and Cravings: When we eat foods we enjoy, dopamine gets released, creating a positive association with that food. This can lead to cravings for those specific foods, especially when ghrelin is also kicking in and making us hungry.
- Junk Food and Dopamine: Highly processed foods like fried chicken are often designed to be hyper-palatable â€“ meaning they trigger strong flavor sensations that lead to a bigger dopamine response.
So, when you're hungry (ghrelin is high), the craving for dopamine can be particularly strong for those "rewarding" junk foods you enjoy. This can make it feel harder to resist them compared to, say, a plate of steamed vegetables.
Here are some additional points:
- Individual Differences: People have varying predispositions to reward-driven eating. Some may be more susceptible to cravings for junk food than others.
- Habitual Eating: Repeatedly indulging in cravings can form strong habits, making it even more challenging to resist them in the future.
Overall, understanding the interplay between ghrelin and dopamine can help you make informed choices about your eating habits. By being mindful of these hunger cues and cravings, you can develop strategies to manage them and make healthier food choices.
