## Plank

"The muscles in our core that engage when we place lateral loads onto our core and midsection, they don't get trained very well with other common sagittal plane [front-to-back movement] exercises," Filly says. To build up that part of your core, flip onto your side for a plank.

Just make sure that your form is on point. Filly cautions against compensating by bending your hips and rolling your top shoulder forward. Again, a straight line is what you want. Really want to work? Tap your hip to the ground or add some weight.

Two to three sets of 10-20 second hard holds

- straight arm
- Side Plank Variations and Hip Taps

## Turkish getup

"This move puts the regular situp to shame," says Filly of this offshoot of [the Turkish getup](https://apple.news/AbSkkGF9QRu-lDHdNHU2QBA "‌"), which gives your core and your shoulder some work. Work your way up to using a weight.

"As you do this exercise, you need to be sure that you initiate from the floor by pressing up hard through the kettlebell and/or the dumbbell," he says. "This is going to engage a muscle called the [serratus anterior](https://apple.news/A8juVG4unSSSr58IrGQbJFg "‌")."

Filly loves hanging variations to train the core. (Not sure how to hang properly for proper tension? Check out our [Form Check guide](https://apple.news/Apg_OEUdJTfKloUl41g1mcg "‌") for some tips on the first part of this move.)

Before you jump to the L-hang, Filly recommends starting with a tuck hang for 30 seconds, then adding weight between your legs. No pullup bar? No problem. Use some parallettes instead.

## Hollow Body Hold
