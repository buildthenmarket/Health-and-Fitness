## Below are two ways to test your grip strength and three exercises to include in your training plan to improve it.

### Grip Strength Test 1: Dead Hang Hold

How long can you hold from a pull-up bar until your forearms start burning, or your grip gives out and you peel right off?

- Less than 30 seconds: F
- 45 seconds to 1 minute: C +
- 1 to 2 minutes: B
- 2 -3 minutes: A --
- 3 minutes or more: A +

### Grip Strength Test 2: Farmer Carry

Can you farmer carry with your body weight (50 percent in each hand) for 50 meters without stopping?

If not, work toward the goal of a bodyweight farmer carry by including the following three exercises in your training plan.

**Grip Strength Exercise 1: Farmer Carry Hold**

With a kettlebell or dumbbell in each hand, stand with perfect posture with the weights in the farmer carry position for 1 minute.

- Work up to 3 sets of 1 minute as heavy as possible.

**Grip Strength Exercise 2: Plate Pinch Hold or Walk**

Do the same as above holding on to 15-25lb plates, or even two if you can manage it. You can also do these as a walking plate pinch.

- Work up to 3 sets of 1 minute or 3 sets of a 40-60-meter walk.

**Grip Strength Exercise 3: Dumbbell Head Hold**

Place two DBs on their ends and pick them up by their head. Hold a farmer carry position this way.

- Work up to 3 sets of 30 seconds to one minute hold.

**Bonus Grip Exercise: Towel Chin-Ups**

This one is a fairly higher level movement, but if you have the strength, toss a towel over the bar and hold onto the towel as you pull your chin over the bar into a pull-up. The [Rope Towel Pull Ups movement is demonstrated here](https://breakingmuscle.com/rope-towel-pull-ups/) as part of the [Breaking Muscle Movement Library](https://breakingmuscle.com/tag/movement-library/).
