Isometric exercises are a type of strength training that involves contracting your muscles without moving your joints. In other words, you're holding a static position for a period of time.

**Benefits of Isometric Exercises:**

- **Strengthens muscles:** While they may not build as much muscle mass as dynamic exercises, isometric exercises can significantly increase muscle strength and endurance.
- **Improves stability and balance:** Holding static positions challenges your core muscles and improves your overall stability.
- **Rehabilitation:** Isometric exercises are often used in physical therapy to rehabilitate injuries or strengthen weakened muscles.
- **Convenience:** They can be done anywhere, anytime, without any equipment.

**Examples of Isometric Exercises:**

- **Plank:** A classic core exercise that engages your abs, back, shoulders, and legs.

- **Wall sit:** Similar to a squat, but you're holding the position against a wall.
- **Push-up hold:** Hold the top position of a push-up.

- **Quadriceps hold:** Stand facing a wall, place your hands on the wall, and slowly lift one leg behind you, keeping it straight.
- **Calf raise hold:** Stand on your tiptoes and hold the position.

**How to Incorporate Isometric Exercises:**

- **Hold each position for 10-30 seconds.**
- **Repeat 2-3 times for each exercise.**
- **You can increase the difficulty by holding the position for longer or adding resistance.**

Isometric exercises are a great way to supplement your regular workout routine or to maintain strength when you can't do traditional weightlifting.

### YWT Hold

**Targets:**¬†Traps, lats, rhomboids, backs of shoulders and erector spinae

**How to:**¬†Lie facedown with arms extended in a Y. Squeeze your upper back muscles and raise your arms up off the floor. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Bend elbows and bring them in toward your torso to form a W. Hold for 20 to 30 more seconds. Extend arms out to the sides to form a T. Hold for another 20 to 30 seconds.

### Dead Hang

**Targets:**¬†Triceps, lats

**How to:**¬†Stand below a pull-up bar. Reach up with an overhand grip and grab the bar, lifting your feet off the floor. Hang as long as you can (aim for 30 seconds).

### Wall Sit

**Targets:**¬†Quads

**How to:**¬†Stand about a foot away from a wall, back to the wall. Lean back until your back comes in contact with the wall. Keeping your spine pressed flat against the wall, bend your knees and lower until quads are parallel to the floor, knees are over toes, and you are in a sitting position. Hold 30 to 60 seconds.
