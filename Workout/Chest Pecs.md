**Compound Exercises:**

* **Pull-ups:** This classic exercise works your back muscles, including the teres major, lats, and biceps.
* **Chin-ups:** Similar to pull-ups, but with a narrower grip, chin-ups place more emphasis on the biceps and teres major.
* **Rows:** This versatile exercise can be done with dumbbells, barbells, or cables. Focus on pulling the weight towards your chest, squeezing your shoulder blades together.

**Isolation Exercises:**

* **Face Pulls:** Using a cable machine or resistance band, pull the handle towards your face, keeping your elbows high and squeezing your shoulder blades together.
* **Bent-Over Rows:** This exercise targets the teres major, lats, and rhomboids. Keep your back flat and pull the weight towards your chest.
* **Rear Delt Flyes:** This exercise primarily targets the rear delts, but also activates the teres major. Use dumbbells or a cable machine to perform this exercise.

**Remember:**

* **Proper Form:** Maintain proper form to avoid injuries and maximize muscle activation.
* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight or resistance to continue challenging your muscles.
* **Rest and Recovery:** Allow your muscles to rest and recover between workouts.
* **Listen to Your Body:** If you experience any pain, stop the exercise and consult a healthcare professional.

By incorporating these exercises into your workout routine, you can effectively target and strengthen your teres major muscles.
