# The Immune System

- T-Cells
- B-Cells
- lymphocytes

## Antigen Presentation

- ST6GACNAC enzyme family

glycans act as markers on cells helping the immune system differentiate between "self" and "non-self"

certain tumors can modify their glycans to evade immune detection

glycan remodeling

## Immune Response

monocytes circulate in bloodstream. when they encounter tissue damage or infection, they migrate there and mature into macrophages. there are different types of macrophages. they break down pathogens into antigens.

- **Macrophages are** white blood cells that swallow up and digest germs, plus dead or dying cells. The macrophages leave behind parts of the invading germs called antigens. The body identifies antigens as dangerous and stimulates antibodies to attack them.
- **B-lymphocytes** are defensive white blood cells; they can produce antibodies to fight off infection.
- **T-lymphocytes** are another type of defensive white blood cell, that recognizes a familiar germ, if the body is exposed again to the same disease

## Lymphatic System Explained

The lymphatic system is a network of organs, vessels, and tissues that work together to maintain fluid balance and support the immune system. It consists of lymph vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs such as the spleen, thymus, and tonsils. Lymph, a clear fluid containing white blood cells, proteins, and fats, flows through the lymphatic vessels and is filtered by lymph nodes, which remove waste, bacteria, and other harmful substances. The system also plays a crucial role in absorbing fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestines and transporting them back into the bloodstream.
