the survival time of microbes (germs) on socks depends on factors such as:

* **Surface type**: Germs can live up to:
  * 5 days on metal
  * 3 days on plastic
  * Several hours on fabric (like cotton or nylon)
* **Environmental conditions**: Germs can survive:
  * Indefinitely in dormant state (e.g., bacterial spores)
  * 20 minutes when actively multiplying (e.g., E.coli and Salmonella)
  * Longer periods in environments with high humidity or temperature fluctuations

## furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

The furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been extensively studied and found to play a crucial role in the virus's biology and transmission. Here are some key aspects of its relevance:

1. **Maturation and activation of the spike protein**: The polybasic furin cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary facilitates the maturation and activation of the spike protein, allowing it to undergo the necessary conformational changes for viral entry and fusion with host cells.
2. **pH-independent entry**: The presence of the furin cleavage site enables SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, which may help the virus evade host cell defenses and promote replication and transmission.
3. **Increased transmissibility**: The furin cleavage site has been suggested to contribute to the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1, as it allows for more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell.
4. **Immune evasion**: The furin cleavage site may also play a role in immune evasion, as it allows the virus to bypass certain host cell defenses, such as IFITM-mediated restriction.
5. **Therapeutic targets**: Strategies targeting the furin-mediated cleavage of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, such as inhibitors or antibodies, may reduce viral replication and transmission by disrupting the virus's ability to mature and activate its spike protein.
6. **Evolutionary adaptations**: The furin cleavage site has been found to be conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta and Omicron, suggesting its importance for viral fitness and transmission.
7. **Regulation by glycosylation**: Recent studies have shown that sequential glycosylations at the multibasic cleavage site regulate viral activity, highlighting the complex interplay between protein processing, glycosylation, and viral function.
In summary, the furin cleavage site is a critical component of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, influencing its maturation, activation, and function, as well as its ability to evade host defenses and transmit between individuals. Its relevance extends to potential therapeutic targets and our understanding of the virus's evolutionary adaptations.
