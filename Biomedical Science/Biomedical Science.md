# Biomedical science

Biomedical scientists work to understand the causes of diseases, develop new treatments and therapies, and improve human health.
Biomedical science is a broad field that applies the principles of biology and other natural sciences to understand and address human health and disease. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including:

* **Physiology:** The study of how the human body functions.

* **Anatomy:** The study of the structure of the human body.

* **Biochemistry:** The study of the chemical processes within and relating to living organisms.

* **Genetics:** The study of genes, heredity, and variation in living organisms.

* **Immunology:** The study of the immune system.

* **Microbiology:** The study of microorganisms.

## Gorilla vs Human Teeth

**Gorilla Teeth:** Gorillas have large canine teeth, which are thought to be used for display and defense, rather than primarily for meat consumption. Their teeth are adapted for grinding tough plant material, such as twigs and bark, indicating an herbivorous diet.

**Human Teeth:** Humans have flat molars and short, blunt canines, which are more similar to those of herbivores than carnivores. Our jaw structure allows for side-to-side and front-to-back movements, ideal for grinding and crushing plant-based foods. Additionally, our salivary amylase activity is high, indicating an ability to digest starchy foods, characteristic of herbivores or frugivores. Our digestive system is also more similar to that of herbivores, with a longer small intestine and smaller stomach capacity, suggesting a diet primarily composed of plant-based foods.

In summary, while gorillas have large canine teeth, their diet is primarily herbivorous. Humans, on the other hand, have teeth and a digestive system more adapted to a herbivorous or frugivorous diet, with a focus on plant-based foods.

### PANCREAS

The pancreas plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels by producing insulin, a hormone that helps control glucose metabolism. When it comes to managing blood sugar levels, consuming low glycemic index (GI) foods can be beneficial.

The glycemic index is a measure of how quickly carbohydrates in food raise blood sugar levels. Low GI foods are those that have a slower and more gradual effect on blood glucose levels, while high GI foods cause a rapid spike in blood sugar.

For individuals with pancreatic issues or those looking to maintain stable blood sugar levels, incorporating low GI foods into their diet can help in several ways:

1. Steady energy levels: Low GI foods provide a slow release of glucose into the bloodstream, resulting in sustained energy levels and preventing energy crashes that can occur with high GI foods.
2. Blood sugar control: Low GI foods help regulate blood sugar levels by preventing sharp spikes and dips. This is particularly important for individuals with conditions like diabetes or insulin resistance.
3. Weight management: Low GI foods tend to be more filling and can help control appetite, reducing the likelihood of overeating. This can be beneficial for weight management and maintaining a healthy body weight.

Examples of low GI foods include:

1. Non-starchy vegetables: Broccoli, spinach, kale, cauliflower, peppers, and zucchini are low in carbohydrates and have a minimal impact on blood sugar.
2. Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, black beans, and kidney beans are high in fiber and protein, making them great options for stabilizing blood sugar levels.
3. Whole grains: Oats, quinoa, brown rice, and whole wheat products contain complex carbohydrates, which are digested more slowly than refined grains.
4. Fruits: Berries, cherries, apples, pears, and grapefruit have lower glycemic loads compared to tropical fruits and dried fruits.
5. Nuts and seeds: Almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and pumpkin seeds are nutrient-dense foods with a low GI and provide healthy fats and fiber.

It's important to note that while low GI foods can be beneficial, a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods is essential for overall health. It's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for personalized advice, especially if you have specific health concerns or conditions related to the pancreas or blood sugar regulation.

## Staphylococcus aureus bacteria

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a Gram-positive, coagulase-negative bacterium that is a normal inhabitant of human skin and mucous membranes. It is part of the human microbiota, typically found on the skin and less commonly in mucosal surfaces and marine sponges. Despite lacking recognized virulence factors, S. epidermidis can cause infection, often on the surface of indwelling medical devices.

### Skin Health and Infection

S. epidermidis plays a dual role in human health. On one hand, it actively primes the cutaneous immune response, maintains skin homeostasis, and prevents opportunistic pathogens from causing disease via colonization resistance. On the other hand, under certain circumstances, it can become an opportunistic pathogen, causing infection when it invades the human body via prosthetic devices or other routes.

**Characteristics**

- Coagulase-negative and catalase-positive
- Facultative anaerobe
- Most common coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species on human skin
- Can form clusters
- Typically harmless in its natural environment, but can become infectious when introduced into the human host

**Clinical Significance**

Staphylococcus epidermidis is a common cause of nosocomial infections in the United States and can lead to serious complications. It is often found as a contaminant in clinical laboratory and hospital environments, but can also cause infections on medical devices and prosthetics.

**Case Fatality Rate (CFR)**:
The CFR is the proportion of confirmed cases of COVID-19 that result in death. It's calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases. This metric is often reported as a percentage.

Example: If there are 100 confirmed cases and 5 deaths, the CFR would be 5% (5 deaths / 100 confirmed cases).

**Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR)**:
The IFR is an estimate of the proportion of all infections (not just confirmed cases) that result in death. This metric is often used to account for asymptomatic or mild cases that may not be reported or tested.

Example: If the IFR is estimated to be 1%, it means that 1% of all infections with SARS-CoV-2 result in death, including both confirmed and unconfirmed cases.

**Crude Mortality Rate**:
The crude mortality rate is the number of deaths per unit of population (e.g., per 100,000 people). This metric is often used to describe the overall burden of disease in a population.

Example: If the crude mortality rate is 10 deaths per 100,000 people, it means that 10 people out of every 100,000 in the population have died from COVID-19.

**Key differences**:

- CFR only considers confirmed cases, while IFR estimates the proportion of all infections (confirmed and unconfirmed).
- CFR is a more immediate measure, reflecting the proportion of cases that result in death shortly after infection. IFR, on the other hand, is a longer-term estimate, accounting for the natural history of the disease, including seroreversion (antibody waning).
- Crude mortality rate provides a broader perspective on the disease burden in a population, while CFR and IFR focus on the proportion of cases or infections that result in death.
