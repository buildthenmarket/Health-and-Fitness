- **Oleuropein.** This is the most abundant antioxidant in fresh, unripe olives. It is linked to many health benefits ([13Trusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746508/)).
- **Hydroxytyrosol.** During olive ripening, oleuropein is broken down into hydroxytyrosol. It is also a powerful [antioxidant](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods-high-in-antioxidants) ([14Trusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31884046/), [15Trusted Source](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33354328/)).
- **Tyrosol.** Most prevalent in olive oil, this antioxidant may have anti-cancer effects ([16Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5691704/), [17Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18460116)).

## Glutathione: Your Body's Master Antioxidant

Glutathione (GSH) is a crucial molecule found in most cells, particularly in the liver, kidneys, lungs, and immune system cells. Often referred to as the body's "master antioxidant," it plays a vital role in many bodily functions:

- **Detoxification:**  GSH helps neutralize free radicals, harmful molecules that damage cells and contribute to aging and disease.  It also aids in eliminating toxins like heavy metals and pollutants from the body.
- **Immune System Support:**  GSH is essential for the proper functioning of immune cells, helping the body fight off infections and illnesses.
- **Tissue Building and Repair:**  GSH is involved in protein synthesis and repair, which is necessary for building and maintaining healthy tissues.

**How Your Body Makes Glutathione:**

Your body naturally produces glutathione from three amino acids: cysteine, glycine, and glutamate.  However, glutathione levels can be depleted due to various factors like:

- **Age:**  Glutathione production tends to decline as we age.
- **Poor Diet:**  Not getting enough of the precursor amino acids can hinder GSH production.
- **Toxins and Stress:**  Exposure to environmental toxins, pollutants, and chronic stress can deplete glutathione stores.

**Glutathione in Food:**

While some dietary sources contain glutathione, it's important to understand a few things:

- **Limited Absorption:**  Dietary GSH itself isn't readily absorbed by the body in significant amounts.
- **Breakdown During Digestion:**  Cooking and processing can further reduce glutathione content in food.

Here's the key takeaway: Consuming foods rich in the **precursor amino acids** (cysteine, glycine, and glutamate) and **supportive nutrients** (vitamin C and selenium) can help your body **synthesize more glutathione** internally.

**Foods that Support Glutathione Production:**

- **Sulfur-Rich Vegetables:**  Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, and asparagus are good sources of sulfur, which is essential for cysteine production.
- **Selenium-Rich Foods:**  Brazil nuts, seafood (tuna, salmon), and eggs are rich in selenium, a mineral that aids in glutathione production.  
- **Vitamin C-Rich Fruits and Vegetables:**  Citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits), bell peppers, kiwi, and strawberries are high in vitamin C, which helps recycle glutathione in the body.
- **Other Potential Sources:**  Milk thistle, avocados, and okra may also contribute to glutathione synthesis, but research is ongoing.

**Remember:**

- While these foods can be helpful, a well-balanced diet and healthy lifestyle are crucial for maintaining optimal glutathione levels.
- Consult a healthcare professional before taking glutathione supplements, as they may not be suitable for everyone.
