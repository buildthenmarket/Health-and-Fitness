## Pharma Clinical Trials

Pharma clinical trials are research studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and side effects of new drugs or treatments in humans. These trials follow a structured process, typically divided into phases (I-IV), and are essential for regulatory approval before a drug can be marketed. Clinical trials involve volunteer participants and are designed to answer specific health questions while ensuring patient safety and scientific integrity.
