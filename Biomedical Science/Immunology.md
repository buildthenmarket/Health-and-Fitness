# immunostasis

Immunostasis refers to the balance and stability of the immune system. It is a branch of homeostasis that focuses on the adaptive and resistive qualities of the immune system and its role in maintaining health. The immune system must maintain a delicate balance to effectively fight off pathogens without causing harm to the body's own tissues.

In the context of immunostasis, the immune system is responsible for recognizing and responding to a wide variety of pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, and cancer cells, while also distinguishing them from the body's healthy tissues. This balance is crucial for preventing both underactivity (which can lead to infections) and overactivity (which can cause autoimmune diseases).

The immune system has two major subsystems: the innate immune system, which provides a preconfigured response to broad groups of pathogens, and the adaptive immune system, which provides a tailored response to each specific stimulus by learning to recognize molecules it has previously encountered. Both systems work together to maintain immunostasis.

Immunostasis can be influenced by various factors, including genetics, environmental exposures, and lifestyle choices. Maintaining a balanced immune system can be achieved through a variety of approaches, including the use of botanical immunodrugs, which can provide a safer and more cost-effective platform for drug discovery. These botanicals are chemically complex and diverse, offering appropriate combinations of synergistic moieties useful in drug discovery to restore immunostasis.

In summary, immunostasis is the state in which the immune system functions optimally, balancing its responses to maintain health and protect against disease.
