COVID-19 vaccines also make a substantial impact on the gut microbiota, reducing its overall population and biodiversity.

## Colon

The human colon, also known as the large intestine, is a vital part of the digestive system. It is responsible for absorbing water and electrolytes from indigestible food matter, forming and storing feces, and facilitating their elimination. The colon is divided into several sections: ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid. It also houses a diverse community of gut microbiota that play important roles in digestion, immune function, and overall health.

## Cecum

The cecum is a pouch-like structure located at the beginning of the large intestine, where the ileum of the small intestine connects to the colon. It plays a role in absorbing fluids and salts that remain after intestinal digestion and absorption, and it serves as a site for the fermentation of dietary fiber by gut bacteria. The cecum also houses the appendix, a small tube-like organ attached to its lower end.
