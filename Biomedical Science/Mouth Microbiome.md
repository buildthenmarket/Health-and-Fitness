## Mouth Microbiome

The mouth microbiome is a complex ecosystem of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that live in your mouth. While some of these microbes can cause problems, most are actually beneficial and help to keep your mouth healthy.

### Beneficial Colonies

- **Streptococcus salivarius:** This is one of the most common bacteria in the mouth and is considered a good bacteria. It helps to produce lactic acid, which prevents the growth of harmful bacteria.
- **Streptococcus mutans:** This bacteria is also a common resident of the mouth. It helps to break down food and produce lactic acid. However, it can also contribute to the formation of plaque and cavities if it grows out of control.
- **Veillonella:** This bacteria is found in the saliva and on the tongue. It helps to break down food and produce lactic acid.
- **Actinomyces:** This bacteria is found in the saliva and on the teeth. It helps to form plaque and can also contribute to the formation of cavities.

### Harmful Colonies

- **Streptococcus sobrinus:** This bacteria is similar to Streptococcus mutans and can also contribute to the formation of plaque and cavities.
- **Porphyromonas gingivalis:** This bacteria is found in the gums and can cause gum disease.
- **Prevotella intermedia:** This bacteria is found in the saliva and can contribute to bad breath.
