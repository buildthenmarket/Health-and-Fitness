# Mitochondria and Aging Diseases

Mitochondria play a central role in human aging, disease, obesity, and metabolic disorders due to their critical functions in cellular metabolism and energy production. During aging, mitochondria undergo progressive dysfunction, characterized by impaired oxidative phosphorylation, increased oxidative damage, and altered dynamics, leading to cell dysfunction and organ failure. This dysfunction is linked to the development of numerous age-related pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Obesity shares similar alterations in the heart as aging, promoting metabolic inflexibility and cardiac dysfunction. Studies have shown that mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics are essential for maintaining proper cell and tissue function, and alterations in these processes are linked to obesity and related metabolic disorders. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of various age-related diseases, making mitochondria potential therapeutic targets for preventing or treating these conditions.
