# Refrigeration

## produce that should not be refrigerated

Several fruits and vegetables should not be refrigerated to maintain their freshness and flavor. Bananas, for example, should be stored at room temperature to prevent premature browning and should only be refrigerated once they are ripe Similarly, tomatoes should be kept at room temperature to avoid losing their juiciness and flavor, as refrigeration can cause them to become mealy

* **Apples**: Can be stored at room temperature for up to two weeks before refrigeration is needed to preserve quality
* **Melons**: Should be allowed to ripen at room temperature before refrigeration once they are sliced
* **Berries**: While they can be stored at room temperature, it's recommended to avoid moisture buildup that could damage them
* **Winter squash (e.g., butternut, acorn)**: Should be stored in a cool, dry place rather than in the refrigerator
* **Potatoes**: Refrigeration can cause potatoes to become gritty and overly sweet due to moisture, so they should be stored in a paper bag at room temperature
* **Onions**: Should be stored in a cool, dry place away from potatoes to prevent mold and softening

## Cherry Tomatoes Storage Instructions

Cherry tomatoes, like other tomatoes, should not be refrigerated because cold temperatures can negatively affect their flavor and texture. Refrigeration can prevent tomatoes from ripening and developing their full flavor. Additionally, chilling tomatoes can cause them to lose some of the volatile compounds that contribute to their taste and aroma While refrigeration can extend the shelf life of tomatoes, it can also make them less flavorful when consumed. This is why grocery store packaging often advises against refrigerating cherry tomatoes to maintain their optimal taste and quality

### Refrigerated vs Room Temperature Tomatoes shelf lives

In summary, cherry tomatoes last about a week at room temperature and up to two weeks when refrigerated.

At room temperature, cherry tomatoes typically last about a week or so. The best way to store them is in a cool place away from direct sunlight, air conditioning vents, or other sources of heat. They should be placed on a baking sheet or in an airtight container with enough space for air circulation, and should not be stacked to avoid bruising and spoilage. Keeping them away from ethylene-producing fruits like apples and bananas can also help prevent faster spoilage

When refrigerated, cherry tomatoes can last up to two weeks. However, refrigeration can cause a slight loss in flavor and texture, making them less ideal for immediate consumption. If you need to extend their shelf life, storing them in the refrigerator is a good option.
