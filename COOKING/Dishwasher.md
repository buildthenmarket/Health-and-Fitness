# Utensils in Dishwasher Positioning

When loading utensils in the dishwasher, it's recommended to face forks and spoons up for optimal cleaning. This allows the water jets to spray the dirty parts more effectively and ensures cleaner utensils For knives, especially sharp ones, it's safer to load them with the blades down and handles up to avoid injury when unloading However, it's generally advised to wash sharp knives by hand to prevent corrosion and damage from the dishwasher's action

If your dishwasher has a basket attached to the door, mix up your utensils and vary their directions to ensure better circulation of water and detergent If the basket is on the bottom rack, load forks and spoons handle-up to allow water to clean all utensils effectively Always ensure there's enough space for the water to clean the utensils thoroughly

For safety and hygiene, wash your hands before handling clean utensils and dishware Loading utensils with handles up can also help prevent germs from your hands transferring to the eating surfaces of the utensils
