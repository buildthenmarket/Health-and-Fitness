## Compatible Vegetables

- **Frozen Vegetables**: Peas, corn, mixed vegetables, etc.

## Handling Frozen and Room-Temperature Vegetables

## Instructions
1. Add rice and water to the rice cooker as usual.
2. Place the steam rack above the rice.
3. Arrange vegetables evenly on the rack.
4. Start the rice cooker. Both rice and vegetables will cook simultaneously.

**Tip**: Adjust cooking time for harder vegetables like carrots or frozen items by starting the rice cooker slightly earlier.
