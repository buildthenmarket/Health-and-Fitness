When it comes to storing and reheating leftover french fries, here's a breakdown of the best practices:

**Storage:**

* **Refrigeration is Key:**
  * It's much safer to store your leftover fries in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature. This is because bacteria multiply rapidly at room temperature, and refrigerated temperatures significantly slow down that process.
  * The USDA recommends not leaving perishable foods, including cooked french fries, at room temperature for more than two hours.
  * When storing them in the fridge, use an airtight container or a sealed bag to help prevent them from becoming too dry. Adding a paper towel to the container can help absorb excess moisture.

**Reheating:**

* **Air Fryer or Toaster Oven: The Preferred Methods:**
  * Both air fryers and toaster ovens excel at reheating fries because they use dry heat, which helps to restore crispiness.
  * **Why these are better than a microwave:**
    * Microwaves tend to make fries soggy because they use moist heat.
  * **Air Fryer:**
    * An air fryer is excellent for quickly reheating fries and achieving a crispy texture.
    * It circulates hot air evenly, ensuring that the fries are heated throughout.
  * **Toaster Oven:**
    * A toaster oven also works well, providing dry heat that helps to crisp the fries.
    * If your toaster oven has a convection setting, use it for even better results.
  * Here are some general tips.
    * Try to spread the fries out on a tray, so the hot air can make contact with as much of the fry surface area as possible.
    * Preheating is also very useful.

**In summary:**

* Refrigerate your leftover fries in an airtight container.
* Reheat them in an air fryer or toaster oven for the best results, prioritizing crispy textures.
