The science and health impact of Cassia cinnamon vs Ceylon cinnamon is a topic of interest due to their differences in composition and potential effects on human health.

* **Ceylon Cinnamon**: Has a lower coumarin content of about 0.004%, which reduces the risk of liver damage and makes it a safer choice for regular consumption. It also contains less of the essential oil cinnamaldehyde and has a sweeter, more delicate flavor.
* **Cassia Cinnamon**: Contains a higher amount of coumarin, ranging from 0.4-0.8%, which may cause liver damage or failure in sensitive individuals, especially when consumed in large amounts. It has a pungent and zesty flavor, and its high coumarin content has led to its ban in some European countries.
* **Coumarin**: A compound present in both types of cinnamon, known for its anti-inflammatory, anticoagulant, and antioxidant properties. However, high levels of coumarin consumption can lead to liver damage, tumors, and other health issues.
* **Cinnamaldehyde**: An essential oil found in cinnamon, which contributes to its flavor and aroma. Ceylon cinnamon contains less cinnamaldehyde than Cassia cinnamon, which may affect its potency and health benefits.
* **Health Benefits**: Both Ceylon and Cassia cinnamon have been shown to have health benefits, including anti-inflammatory properties, blood sugar regulation, and antioxidant effects. However, Ceylon cinnamon is considered a safer choice due to its lower coumarin content.
