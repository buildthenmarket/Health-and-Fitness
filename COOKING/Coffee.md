## Frother

- **Oat Milk:**
  - Look for oat milks with very short ingredient lists. Some brands are beginning to produce oat milks with just oats, water, and perhaps a touch of salt.
  - When possible, consider making your own oat milk. This is the best way to control the ingredients.
- **Soy Milk:**
  - Plain, unsweetened soy milk can be a good option. Some brands offer soy milk with just soybeans and water.  
  - Elmhurst brand soy milks are an example of this.
- **Macadamia Milk:**
  - Milkadamia offers barista blends that have great foaming capabilities. They also are a good choice for those who are trying to avoid many additives.

## Blooming

The article "What is Coffee Blooming According to the Science" on Serious Eats explains the concept of coffee blooming, which occurs when hot water is first poured over coffee grounds. This process releases carbon dioxide bubbles trapped in the beans, indicating freshness and affecting extraction.

Key points include:

1. **Definition of Blooming**: Blooming involves adding a small amount of water to coffee grounds and allowing it to sit for 30-45 seconds. This helps release CO2, which can hinder flavor extraction if not removed.

2. **Importance of Blooming**: Proper blooming ensures an even saturation of coffee grounds, enhancing extraction and flavor. Observing the bubbles can indicate how well the coffee is blooming and if adjustments are needed.

3. **Timing and Techniques**: While 30-45 seconds is common for blooming, some experts suggest longer blooms, up to ten minutes, can increase sweetness and extraction. Agitation during blooming can also help release CO2.

4. **Factors Influencing Blooming**: The roast date, roast level, and water temperature all impact the blooming process. Freshly roasted coffee tends to produce more bubbles, while darker roasts may bubble more aggressively but dissipate quickly.

5. **Conclusion**: Paying attention to the bubbles during brewing can provide insights into the coffee's freshness and brewing quality, allowing for adjustments to achieve the best flavor.

Overall, the article emphasizes that the initial moments of brewing are crucial for achieving an optimal cup of coffee.

## Coffee Freshness

Here are some ideas to improve homemade coffee freshness:

**1. Buy smaller bags**: Purchasing smaller bags of coffee beans ensures you use them within a shorter period, reducing the likelihood of staleness.

**2. Use whole beans**: Grinding your own whole beans just before brewing preserves the coffee's natural oils and flavors, resulting in a fresher taste.

**3. Store coffee beans properly**: Keep beans in airtight containers, such as ceramic or glass jars with tight-fitting lids, to prevent exposure to air, light, and moisture.

**4. Store in a cool, dark place**: Avoid storing coffee beans near heat sources, ovens, or direct sunlight, as these can cause degradation and staleness.

**5. Freeze for longer storage**: If you can't use up your coffee beans quickly, consider freezing them in airtight containers or freezer bags to preserve freshness for up to 6-12 months.

**6. Use a grinder with a built-in scale**: Grinders with scales allow you to grind exactly the amount you need, reducing waste and preserving freshness.

**7. Grind immediately before brewing**: Grinding just before brewing ensures the coffee is as fresh as possible, as grinding exposes the beans to oxygen and light, which can cause staleness.

**8. Consider a coffee bean subscription**: Many coffee roasters offer subscription services, which ensure a regular supply of fresh beans and can help you avoid stale coffee.

**9. Use a coffee canister with a one-way valve**: These canisters allow carbon dioxide to escape while keeping oxygen out, preserving the coffee's natural flavors and aromas.

**10. Monitor the "Roasted on" date**: Check the roast date on your coffee beans and aim to use them within 2-4 weeks for filter brews and 1-6 weeks for espresso, depending on the roast level and type.

By implementing these ideas, you can significantly improve the freshness and flavor of your homemade coffee.

### Coffee Mold Statistics

Research indicates that mold, including mycotoxins like aflatoxin B1 and ochratoxin A, can be present in coffee beans. Here are some statistics:

- **Brazil**: A study found that nearly all green coffee bean samples (over 90%) were contaminated with mold, and 33% contained low levels of ochratoxin A.
- **Portugal**: 18% of roasted coffee bean samples analyzed contained ochratoxin A.
- **Nayarit, Mexico**: A study collected 14 roasted coffee samples, from which 22 fungi isolates were related to the genera Aspergillus and Penicillium. Three strains tested positive for ochratoxin A (OTA) production.
- **Global**: A 2013 study found that 27% of all roast coffees tested contained ochratoxin A, with beans from Chile having the highest concentrations.

These statistics suggest that while mold and mycotoxins can be found in coffee, the levels are generally low and within safe limits.

## Coffee vs Espresso

Espresso and black coffee are both made from coffee beans but differ in their preparation methods and characteristics. Espresso is made by forcing pressurized hot water through finely ground coffee beans, resulting in a concentrated shot of coffee with a thick texture and a layer of crema on top Black coffee, on the other hand, is simply coffee brewed without any additives like milk or sugar, using a coarser grind and a longer brewing time Espresso has a stronger flavor and higher caffeine concentration per serving due to its concentrated nature, while black coffee tends to have a milder taste and a larger serving size

## Espresso Machine

### Can I Reuse Espresso Grounds?

Using the same grounds that are already loaded in your espresso machine to make another cup is not recommended. Espresso grounds are designed to be used for one extraction per portafilter filling, and reusing them would result in increasingly weaker brews with unpleasant flavors, such as excessive bitterness or sour notes Each cup of espresso should ideally be made with fresh grounds to ensure the best taste and quality.
