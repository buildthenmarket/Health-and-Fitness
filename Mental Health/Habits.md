Habits are learned behaviors that become automatic over time. They involve a cue, a routine, and a reward. Understanding the habit loop can help us break bad habits and form new, positive ones.

## "we do not rise to the level of our goals, we fall to the level of our systems.”

Within our self-imposed systems, our execution is also capped at our love level.

Whether you love your job, have fallen out of love with it, or have never loved it all, the work to sustain it, find our way back, or find the job that we do love, is key to both success and happiness.

## Identify Bad Habit

- disrupt the normal routine, you will get focus

**It takes three steps to identify and break a bad habit:**

1. **Cue:** When, where, with whom, or after which activity do you feel the urge for your habit?
2. **Reward:** What craving are you trying to satisfy?
3. **Routine:** Can you train yourself to do something else that satisfies the same need?

13. **An abundance mindset opens you up to more opportunities.** Practice feeling genuine happiness for others' successes to dissolve unconscious scarcity fears through the law of attraction.

14. **Luck happens more often for those who show up consistently with focused effort and intention.** Double down on diligent habits and processes to compound positive results exponentially.

15. **Your worth isn't defined by fleeting status symbols or busy schedules.** Celebrate intrinsic rewards like rest, relationships and personal growth over external validation.

16. **Move your gauge of success squarely into dimensions you can directly influence (i.e. focus on what you can control).** This gave me a greater sense of control and empowerment. Judge yourself by metrics within your control rather than comparing to others. This builds agency.

17. **Not having an opinion on something unfamiliar is wise.** Get comfortable saying "I don't know enough yet" with humble honesty rather than guessing. This allows non-defensive learning later.

18. **Feedback reflecting lack of awareness provides a gift of clarity.** Express gratitude for critique revealing blind spots, rather than getting defensive. This allows for improvement.

19. **Progress requires patience with yourself and others alike.** Lead with compassion - we're all doing our best with current awareness. This grace allows learning without shame.

20. **Joy is found through courage, not control.** Step outside comfort zones, where the magic happens. Each leap builds confidence and reveals new depths within.

21. **Learning never stops; complacency is the enemy of achievement.** Expose yourself continuously to novel ideas to stay curious and reach your potential.

22. **No experience is ever wasted, as everything offers self-discovery if you pay attention.** Embrace painful endings mindfully as portals offering spiritual nutrition full of lessons.

23. **Good enough may open the road to greatness down the line.** Forgive yourself for reasonable imperfection to ease overwhelm, building energy for your bigger vision.
