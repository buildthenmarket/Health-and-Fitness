**Neurotransmitters:**

- **Serotonin:** This neurotransmitter helps regulate mood, sleep, and appetite. Low levels of serotonin have been linked to impulsive behavior.

**Psychological Factors:**

- **Personality Traits:** Certain personality traits, such as impulsivity and sensation-seeking, can make individuals more prone to impulsive actions.
- **Emotional State:** Strong emotions, such as anger, frustration, or excitement, can impair our ability to think rationally and make impulsive decisions more likely.
