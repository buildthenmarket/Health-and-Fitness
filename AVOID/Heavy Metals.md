# Heavy Metals

Heavy metals and aflatoxins are two significant contaminants that can pose health risks through dietary exposure. Here’s an overview of the science behind these contaminants and the foods to avoid to minimize exposure.

## Heavy Metals

**Common Heavy Metals:**

1. **Lead**: Found in contaminated water, soil, and some imported goods.
2. **Mercury**: Often found in large fish due to environmental pollution.
3. **Cadmium**: Can accumulate in certain crops, particularly in polluted soils.
4. **Arsenic**: Common in rice products and water in certain areas.

**Health Risks:**

- **Lead**: Can affect neurological development, particularly in children, and cause cognitive deficits.
- **Mercury**: Linked to neurological issues, including memory loss and cognitive decline.
- **Cadmium**: Associated with kidney damage and bone fragility.
- **Arsenic**: Long-term exposure is linked to cancer and skin lesions.

**Foods to Avoid:**

- **Large Fish**: Such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish, which can have high levels of mercury.
- **Rice Products**: Brown rice and rice-based snacks can contain arsenic; consider limiting rice consumption or choosing alternatives like quinoa or barley.
- **Imported Chocolates**: Some may contain lead due to contamination during processing.
- **Certain Vegetables**: Leafy greens and root vegetables grown in contaminated soil may accumulate heavy metals like cadmium.

## Hershey's Chocolates

Hershey's is facing a lawsuit over allegations that its dark chocolate bars contain heavy metals, specifically lead and cadmium. According to Consumer Reports, just one ounce of certain Hershey's Special Dark Mildly Sweet Chocolate, Lily's Extra Dark Chocolate 70% Cocoa, and Lily's Extreme Dark Chocolate 85% Cocoa exceeds California's maximum allowable dose levels (MADL) for these substances. The lawsuit seeks $5 million from Hershey's, claiming that its advertising and marketing campaign for the dark chocolate bars is "false, deceptive, and misleading."

## Detecting and Avoiding Cadmium and Arsenic in Rice

**Detection:**
- **Check for Testing and Certifications:** Look for rice brands that provide third-party testing results for heavy metals or carry certifications indicating low heavy metal content.
- **Origin Matters:** Rice grown in certain regions (e.g., parts of the U.S. South, India, Bangladesh, and China) may have higher arsenic or cadmium levels due to soil and water contamination. Prefer rice from regions with stricter environmental controls, such as California or some European countries.
- **Product Labels:** Some brands label their rice as "low arsenic" or "tested for heavy metals." Review packaging or company websites for this information.

**Avoidance:**
- **Rinse Thoroughly:** Rinse rice several times before cooking to remove some surface contaminants.
- **Cook with Excess Water:** Use a high water-to-rice ratio (e.g., 6:1), then drain the excess water after cooking. This can reduce arsenic content by up to 60%.
- **Vary Your Grains:** Rotate rice with other grains like quinoa, millet, barley, or bulgur to reduce overall exposure.
- **Choose White Rice Over Brown:** Brown rice tends to accumulate more arsenic and cadmium than white rice, as these metals concentrate in the outer layers.
- **Limit Rice-Based Processed Foods:** Rice crackers, cereals, and snacks can also contain heavy metals—moderate your intake.

**Summary Table:**

| Step                  | Effectiveness | Notes                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Rinse rice            | Moderate     | Removes some surface contaminants          |
| Cook with excess water| High         | Significantly reduces arsenic              |
| Choose origin wisely  | High         | California rice often lower in arsenic     |
| Rotate grains         | High         | Reduces cumulative exposure                |
| Prefer white rice     | Moderate     | Less arsenic/cadmium than brown rice       |

## Soy Protein Isolates

Foods to Avoid with Soy Isolate

Based on the provided search results, here's a summary of foods to avoid or be cautious with when consuming Soy Protein Isolates (SPI) due to potential heavy metal contamination:

1. **Plant-based protein powders**: SPI is often found in plant-based protein powders, particularly those made from soybeans. A study by the Clean Label Project found that 40% of 134 plant-based protein powders tested contained elevated levels of heavy metals, including lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic.
2. **Certified organic products**: Surprisingly, certified organic products were twice as likely to contain high levels of heavy metals as non-organic products. This may be due to the use of contaminated soil or water in organic farming practices.
3. **Whey protein powders with plant ingredients**: Whey protein powders that contain plant ingredients, such as soy or pea protein, may also be contaminated with heavy metals. A study found that 5 out of 5 top-rated whey protein powders with plant ingredients contained low levels of heavy metals.
4. **Foods with hexane processing**: SPI is often produced using hexane, a solvent that can leave behind residues of heavy metals like aluminum and other chemicals. Foods that contain SPI, such as protein bars or supplements, may be contaminated with these residues.

The science behind the potential harm of heavy metals in SPI is as follows:

- **Toxicity**: Heavy metals like lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic are toxic to the human body and can cause a range of health problems, including kidney damage, neurological disorders, and cancer.
- **Bioaccumulation**: Heavy metals can accumulate in the body over time, leading to increased exposure and potential harm.
- **Phytates**: SPI contains phytates, which can reduce the body's ability to absorb essential minerals like iron and zinc.

To minimize exposure to heavy metals from SPI, consider the following:

- Choose whey protein powders without plant ingredients or those that have undergone rigorous testing for heavy metal contamination.
- Opt for products from reputable manufacturers that use non-hexane processing methods.
- Limit your consumption of plant-based protein powders and choose certified non-GMO and non-organic options.
- Consider consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized guidance on protein powder selection.

Remember that individual tolerance to heavy metals can vary, and it's essential to prioritize your overall health and well-being by making informed choices about your diet and supplement use.
