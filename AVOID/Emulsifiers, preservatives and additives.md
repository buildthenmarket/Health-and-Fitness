# Emulsifiers, preservatives and additives

Try to stay away from processed foods, and eat fresh, organic and raw food instead.

## excitotoxins

### Excitotoxins are substances that overstimulate nerve cells, potentially leading to cell death.

- excitotoxins are added to make them *tastier*
- aspartame and monosodium glutamate (MSG).
- increases the free radicals and lipid peroxidation products in the walls of their arteries, the increase lasted for what would be the equivalent of decades in humans.” In addition, these chemicals can cross the placental barrier, possibly harming the brains of unborn children.
- 1981, the FDA’s own doctors recommended that aspartame shouldn’t be approved based on the studies of mice exhibiting brain tumors. Dr. Adrian Gross, former FDA toxicologist, testified before the Senate on the aspartame issue, stating, “It is clear beyond any shadow of a doubt that aspartame has caused cancer in laboratory animals.” Unfortunately, it didn’t make a difference. The recommendation fell on deaf ears.


## Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA)

Butylated Hydroxyanisole (BHA) is a synthetic antioxidant commonly used as a preservative in various products, including:

* **Food:** To prevent oxidation and rancidity in fats and oils, BHA is often found in cereals, snack foods, chewing gum, and other processed foods.
* **Cosmetics:** BHA is used in lipsticks, moisturizers, and other cosmetics to maintain their stability and prevent spoilage.
* **Other Products:** BHA can also be found in animal feed, rubber products, and petroleum-based products.

**Health Concerns and Controversies:**

While BHA is generally recognized as safe by regulatory agencies like the FDA, some concerns have been raised about its potential health effects:

* **Carcinogenic Potential:** Some studies have suggested a link between BHA and cancer, particularly in animal models. However, human studies have not shown a clear association.
* **Allergic Reactions:** BHA can cause allergic reactions in some individuals, especially those with sensitive skin.
* **Endocrine Disruption:** There is some evidence suggesting that BHA may interfere with hormone function, although more research is needed to confirm this.

**Regulatory Status:**

BHA is approved for use as a food additive in many countries, including the United States. However, its use is regulated, and the amount allowed in food products is limited.

**Consumer Considerations:**

While BHA is widely used and generally considered safe, it's important to be aware of its potential risks and to make informed choices:

* **Read Labels:** Check the ingredient list of food and cosmetic products to see if they contain BHA.
* **Choose Alternatives:** If you have concerns about BHA, you can opt for products that do not contain it.
* **Limit Exposure:** While BHA is generally safe in small amounts, it's best to limit overall exposure to chemicals, including BHA, by eating a balanced diet and using natural products whenever possible.

It's important to consult with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian if you have specific concerns about BHA or other food additives.

## Maltodextrin: Overview and Health Considerations

**What is Maltodextrin?**
Maltodextrin is a polysaccharide derived from starch, commonly used as a food additive. It is produced through the hydrolysis of starch, which breaks it down into shorter chains of glucose molecules. Maltodextrin is typically used as a thickener, filler, or preservative in various processed foods.

### Scientific Concerns

1. **Glycemic Index**: Maltodextrin has a high glycemic index (GI), often comparable to glucose. This means it can cause rapid spikes in blood sugar levels, which may lead to insulin resistance over time if consumed in excess. This is particularly concerning for individuals with diabetes or those trying to manage weight.

2. **Digestive Issues**: Some people may experience digestive discomfort when consuming maltodextrin, especially in large quantities. It can lead to symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea.

3. **Potential Allergens**: While maltodextrin is generally considered safe, it can be derived from various sources, including corn, rice, and potatoes. For individuals with allergies or sensitivities to these sources, maltodextrin can trigger reactions.

4. **Impact on Gut Health**: Some studies suggest that maltodextrin may negatively affect gut microbiota, potentially promoting the growth of harmful bacteria and reducing beneficial bacteria. This can impact overall gut health and immune function.

**Maltodextrin destroys good gut bacteria**

### Foods to Avoid

To limit maltodextrin intake, consider avoiding or being cautious with the following food categories:

1. **Processed Foods**: Many packaged snacks, such as chips, cookies, and crackers, often contain maltodextrin as a filler or preservative.

2. **Sugary Beverages**: Certain powdered drink mixes and energy drinks may include maltodextrin to enhance sweetness and texture.

3. **Instant Foods**: Instant cereals, sauces, and soups can contain maltodextrin to improve consistency and shelf life.

4. **Diet and Protein Supplements**: Some protein powders and meal replacement shakes use maltodextrin for texture and to increase carbohydrate content.

5. **Frozen Foods**: Many frozen meals and pre-packaged items may include maltodextrin as an ingredient.

### Conclusion

While maltodextrin is generally recognized as safe by regulatory authorities, it is important to be mindful of its potential effects on blood sugar levels and gut health. Reading ingredient labels carefully and limiting consumption of processed foods can help manage your intake of maltodextrin. Opting for whole, unprocessed foods is the best strategy for maintaining overall health and well-being.
