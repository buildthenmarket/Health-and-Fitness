Guide to Avoiding Toxic Chemicals in Cosmetics
==============================================

To make informed decisions while shopping for cosmetics and personal care products, consumers should be aware of the "Toxic Twelve" chemicals and contaminants identified by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) as harmful. These chemicals, linked to serious health risks like cancer, reproductive harm, and neurological damage, are often found in cosmetics due to limited FDA oversight. Below is an actionable guide to avoid these toxins by reading labels, choosing safer products, and staying informed.

The Toxic Twelve to Avoid
-------------------------

The following chemicals and contaminants are highlighted in California's proposed Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act (A.B. 2762) and should be avoided due to their health risks:

1. **Formaldehyde**: A known carcinogen linked to cancer.
2. **Paraformaldehyde**: A form of formaldehyde, also carcinogenic.
3. **Methylene Glycol**: Another formaldehyde variant, posing cancer risks.
4. **Quaternium-15**: Releases formaldehyde, increasing cancer risk.
5. **Mercury**: Can damage kidneys and the nervous system.
6. **Dibutyl Phthalate (DBP)**: An endocrine disruptor that harms male reproductive development and may cause early puberty in boys.
7. **Diethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP)**: Disrupts hormones, harms reproductive systems, and is classified as possibly carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.
8. **Isobutyl Paraben**: Disrupts hormones and harms reproductive health.
9. **Isopropyl Paraben**: Similarly disrupts hormones and affects reproduction.
10. **Long-Chain PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)**: Linked to cancer and environmental persistence.
11. **m-Phenylenediamine**: Used in hair dyes, irritates skin, damages DNA, and may cause cancer.
12. **o-Phenylenediamine**: Also used in hair dyes, with similar risks of skin irritation and potential carcinogenicity.

Actionable Steps for Safer Shopping
-----------------------------------

### 1\. Read Product Labels Carefully

- **Look for Listed Toxins**: Check ingredient lists for the Toxic Twelve, especially formaldehyde, mercury, parabens, and phenylenediamines.
- **Beware of "Fragrance"**: Phthalates (DBP and DEHP) may be hidden under "fragrance" or "parfum" due to federal labeling exemptions. Opt for products that disclose all fragrance components or are labeled "phthalate-free."
- **Note Subtle Variations**: Formaldehyde may appear as quaternium-15, paraformaldehyde, or methylene glycol. Be vigilant for these synonyms.

### 2\. Use EWG's Skin Deep Database

- Access EWG's Skin Deep database ([www.ewg.org/skindeep](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep)) to check product safety ratings and identify those containing the Toxic Twelve.
- Example: EWG found isobutyl paraben in only 96 products and isopropyl paraben in 12 products since 2017, indicating these are less common but still present.

### 3\. Shop at Retailers with Strict Policies

- Choose retailers that restrict harmful chemicals:
  - **CVS Health**: Bans formaldehyde, formaldehyde-releasing chemicals, many parabens, DBP, and DEHP.
  - **Target, Walgreens, Rite Aid**: Have restricted substance lists prohibiting many of the Toxic Twelve.
  - **Whole Foods**: Enforces body care standards banning these chemicals.
- These retailers' store brands are safer bets for avoiding toxic ingredients.

### 4\. Choose Brands Supporting Safer Regulation

- Support companies advocating for stricter FDA oversight, such as:
  - Beautycounter, L'Oreal, Johnson & Johnson, The Honest Company, Estee Lauder, and Procter & Gamble.
  - These brands support reforms like mandatory FDA registration, ingredient disclosure, and recall authority.
- Check brand websites for their chemical policies or commitments to safer ingredients.

### 5\. Be Cautious with Imported Products

- Cosmetic imports, especially from China, have risen 79% from 2011 to 2016, and many lack strict oversight. Verify that imported products meet EU or similar safety standards, which ban over 1,400 harmful chemicals, including all Toxic Twelve.

### 6\. Understand Health Risks

- **Chronic Risks**: Chemicals like phthalates and parabens are endocrine disruptors, posing risks during pregnancy or early development, potentially leading to breast cancer or immune system harm.
- **Acute Risks**: Formaldehyde in keratin treatments can cause hair loss, rashes, blisters, and respiratory issues. Avoid products linked to such effects.
- **Contaminants**: Look out for heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, nickel) and bacterial contamination in products like body wash, face powders, and lotions.

### 7\. Advocate for Stronger Regulations

- Support legislation like California's Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act to ban harmful chemicals.
- Contact legislators to push for FDA authority to review cosmetics, require ingredient transparency, and enforce recalls, aligning U.S. standards with the EU's stricter regulations.

### 8\. Minimize Exposure

- **Reduce Usage**: Women use an average of 12 personal care products daily (168 chemicals), and men use 6 (85 chemicals). Limit the number of products to reduce chemical exposure.
- **Choose Simpler Formulations**: Opt for products with shorter, transparent ingredient lists to minimize risk.
- **Avoid High-Risk Products**: Be cautious with hair dyes (due to phenylenediamines) and keratin treatments (due to formaldehyde).

Additional Tips
---------------

- **Look for Certifications**: Seek products labeled as "EWG Verified" or certified by third-party organizations ensuring low-toxicity ingredients.
- **Stay Informed**: Follow EWG updates or check [www.ewg.org](http://www.ewg.org/) for new research on cosmetic safety.
- **Report Adverse Effects**: If a product causes irritation, hair loss, or other issues, report it to the FDA's MedWatch program ([www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch](http://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch)) to raise awareness.

By prioritizing these steps, you can reduce exposure to harmful chemicals, make safer purchasing decisions, and support a cosmetics industry that prioritizes consumer health.
