# BREAD ADDITIVES

## Azodicarbonamide

- **Azodicarbonamide:** This chemical is used as a dough conditioner. While it is not directly carcinogenic, it breaks down into substances that may be harmful.

Azodicarbonamide (ACA), a chemical that forms bubbles in foams and plastics like vinyl, is used to bleach and leaven dough – but when baked, it, too, has been linked to cancer in lab animals.

## Acrylamide

 This chemical forms naturally during high-temperature cooking processes, including baking bread. While research is ongoing, some studies suggest a possible link to cancer.

## Potassium bromate

Potassium bromate is a chemical compound that has been linked to several health concerns, particularly its potential to cause cancer. Here's a breakdown of the science behind these concerns:

**Carcinogenic Potential:**

- **Animal Studies:** Numerous studies on animals have shown that potassium bromate can cause various types of cancer, including kidney, thyroid, and stomach cancer.
- **Mechanism of Action:** It's believed that potassium bromate damages DNA and interferes with cellular processes, leading to the development of cancerous cells.

**Other Health Risks:**

- **Neurotoxicity:** Some studies suggest that potassium bromate may affect the nervous system, leading to symptoms like headaches, irritability, and impaired cognitive function.
- **Reproductive Toxicity:** There's concern that potassium bromate may have adverse effects on reproductive health, although more research is needed.

**Regulatory Status:**

- **Banned in Many Countries:** Many countries, including the European Union, Canada, and China, have banned the use of potassium bromate as a food additive due to its potential health risks.
- **Regulated in the US:** In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows the use of potassium bromate in flour, but it must be listed on the product label.

**Consumer Considerations:**

- **Read Labels:** Check the ingredient list of baked goods to see if they contain potassium bromate.
- **Choose Alternatives:** Opt for products made with potassium bromate-free flour.
- **Support Regulations:** Advocate for stricter regulations on food additives and encourage the banning of potassium bromate.

It's important to note that while the scientific evidence suggests a link between potassium bromate and health risks, more research is needed to fully understand the extent of these risks in humans. However, given the potential dangers, it's advisable to limit exposure to this chemical by making informed choices about the food you consume.

- **Prolamins and agglutinins**: These harmful and [inflammatory proteins are found in grains](https://michaelkummer.com/why-avoid-grains/) such as wheat, rye, barley, oats and corn.
- **Digestive enzyme inhibitors**: Certain grains, such as wheat, [can significantly lower the amounts of digestive enzymes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22878393). Yet another reason to avoid grains in your diet.

### Bromate

Carb free, gluten free, white, wheat, multi-grain, whole grain. There's a lot of stress around bread. But what we don't hear a lot about is bromated vs. unbromated flour. There is an additive in flour here in the States, that quickens leavening thereby increasing production. It also happens to be carcinogenic.
