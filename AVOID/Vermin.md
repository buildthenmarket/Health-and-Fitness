# Vermin

Vermin like cockroaches and rodents can transmit a variety of diseases and illnesses to humans, primarily through contamination of food and surfaces, contact with their waste, or indirectly through parasites they carry.
Here's a breakdown:

## Diseases and Illnesses Transmitted by Cockroaches:

Cockroaches are not typically direct vectors (like mosquitoes that bite and transmit), but rather mechanical vectors, picking up pathogens on their bodies and in their digestive systems from unsanitary environments and then spreading them.

* Bacterial Infections:
    * Salmonellosis: Causes symptoms similar to food poisoning (diarrhea, fever, abdominal cramps).
    * E. coli: Can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues.
    * Typhoid Fever: A serious bacterial infection.
    * Cholera: An acute diarrheal infection.
    * Dysentery: A type of gastroenteritis resulting in bloody diarrhea.
    * Campylobacteriosis: A common bacterial infection in humans.
    * Listeriosis: Transmitted by eating contaminated food.
    * Staphylococcus aureus & Streptococcus: Can cause various infections.
    * Leprosy: Cockroaches are suspected carriers of the bacterium.
    * Plague: While primarily rodent-borne, cockroaches are suspected of spreading the bacterium.
* Parasitic Worms: Cockroaches can carry and spread various types of parasitic worms.
* Allergies and Asthma: Cockroach allergens (from their shed skin, feces, and saliva) are a significant trigger for allergies and can exacerbate asthma symptoms, especially in children. Inhaling these airborne particles can lead to coughing, wheezing, skin rashes, and nasal congestion.

## Diseases and Illnesses Transmitted by Rodents (Rats and Mice):

Rodents can transmit diseases directly (through bites, contact with urine/droppings/saliva) or indirectly (through fleas, ticks, or mites that have fed on infected rodents).

* Viral Diseases:
    * Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS): A severe, often fatal respiratory disease caused by inhaling airborne particles from rodent urine, droppings, or nesting materials, or less commonly, through rodent bites. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, and later, severe breathing difficulties.
    * Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCMV): Primarily associated with the common house mouse. Can cause flu-like symptoms and sometimes neurological issues like meningitis.
    * Hemorrhagic Fevers (e.g., Lassa Fever, Omsk Hemorrhagic Fever): A group of severe viral illnesses.
* Bacterial Diseases:
    * Salmonellosis: Contamination of food or water by rodent feces can lead to this foodborne illness.
    * Leptospirosis: Caused by bacteria found in rodent urine, entering the body through cuts or mucous membranes. Can lead to liver and kidney damage.
    * Rat-Bite Fever: Transmitted through bites or scratches from infected rodents, or contact with their waste. Symptoms include fever, rash, and joint pain.
    * Plague: Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of infected fleas that have fed on rodents.
    * Tularemia: Can be transmitted through handling infected rodents or by the bite of infected ticks or flies that have fed on rodents.
    * Murine Typhus: Transmitted by infected fleas that live on rodents.
* Parasitic Diseases: Rodents can carry parasites like tapeworms, giardia, and cryptosporidium, which can then be transmitted to humans.
* Allergies: Similar to cockroaches, rodent dander, urine, and droppings can trigger allergic reactions and asthma symptoms in sensitive individuals.
General Transmission Routes:
* Contaminated food and water: The most common way diseases are spread, as vermin walk over or defecate/urinate on food preparation surfaces, utensils, and stored food.
* Aerosolized particles: Inhaling dust contaminated with dried feces, urine, or saliva from rodents or body parts/feces from cockroaches.
* Direct contact: Touching contaminated surfaces, then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth, or handling infected animals or their waste.
* Bites and scratches: Direct transmission from a rodent bite or scratch.
* Indirect via vectors: Bites from fleas, ticks, or mites that have fed on infected rodents.
