Genetic modification is a special set of gene technology that alters the genetic machinery of such living organisms as animals, plants or microorganisms. Combining genes from different organisms is known as recombinant DNA technology and the resulting organism is said to be ‘Genetically modified (GM)’, ‘Genetically engineered’ or ‘Transgenic’. The principal transgenic crops grown commercially in field are herbicide and insecticide resistant soybeans, corn, cotton and canola. Other crops grown commercially and/or field-tested are sweet potato resistant to a virus that could destroy most of the African harvest, rice with increased iron and vitamins that may alleviate chronic malnutrition in Asian countries and a variety of plants that are able to survive weather extremes. There are bananas that produce human vaccines against infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, fish that mature more quickly, fruit and nut trees that yield years earlier and plants that produce new plastics with unique properties. Technologies for genetically modifying foods offer dramatic promise for meeting some areas of greatest challenge for the 21st century. Like all new technologies, they also pose some risks, both known and unknown.

## Ways to reduce pesticide exposure from foods

The following are simple, safe and powerful methods you can use to reduce pesticide residues on produce:

- **Scrub them in cold water:** Rinsing fruit and vegetables in cold water while scrubbing them with a soft brush can remove some pesticide residues ([20Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29222908)).
- **Baking soda water:** A study found that washing apples with a 1% [baking soda](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/baking-soda-benefits-uses) and water mixture was more effective in removing pesticide residues than tap water alone ([21Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29067814)).
- **Peel fruits and vegetables:** [Removing the skin](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/peeling-fruits-veggies) of Dirty Dozen fruits and vegetables can significantly reduce dietary intake of pesticide residues ([22Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5580537/)).
- **Blanching:** In one study blanching produce (exposing it to boiling, then cold, water) led to a more than 50% reduction in pesticide residue levels in all vegetable and fruit samples except peaches ([23Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3907644/)).
- **Boiling:** A study found that boiling strawberries significantly decreased pesticide residues, with reductions of 42.8--92.9% ([24Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4688301/)).
- **Rinse produce with ozonated water:** Ozonated water (water mixed with a type of oxygen called ozone) has been found to be particularly effective in removing pesticide residues from food ([25Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27098519), [26Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26565682)).

## Dirty Dozen

1. **Strawberries:** Conventional strawberries consistently top the Dirty Dozen list. In 2023, the EWG found that 30% of all strawberry samples contained ten or more pesticide residues.
2. **Spinach:** 76% of spinach samples contained pesticide residues, including permethrin, a neurotoxic insecticide that is highly toxic to animals ([6Trusted Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5598406/)).
3. **Kale, mustard, and collard greens.** 86% of all samples of leafy greens were found to contain two or more pesticide residues, including the neurotoxins imidacloprid, bifenthrin and cypermethrin.
4. **Peaches:** Over 99% of the peaches tested by the EWG contained pesticide residues, with 65% containing at least four.
5. **Pears:** Over 63% of pears tested by the EWG contained residues from five or more pesticides.
6. **Nectarines:** The EWG detected residues in nearly 94% of nectarine samples, with one sample containing over 15 different pesticide residues.
7. **Apples:** The EWG detected pesticide residues in 90% of apple samples. What's more, 80% of the apples tested contained traces of diphenylamine, a pesticide banned in Europe.
8. **Grapes:** Conventional [grapes](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-grapes) are a staple on the Dirty Dozen list, with over 96% testing positive for pesticide residues.
9. **Bell and hot peppers:** Sweet bell peppers contain fewer pesticide residues compared to other fruits and vegetables. Yet, the EWG cautions that pesticides used on sweet bell peppers "tend to be more toxic to human health."
10. **Cherries:** The EWG detected an average of five pesticide residues on cherry samples, including a pesticide called iprodione, which is banned in Europe.
11. **Blueberries:** The EWG found that 90% of blueberries had pesticide residues, with 80% containing two or more.
12. **Green beans:** The EWG added green beans to the Dirty Dozen list after finding that 90% of samples contained pesticides, including acephate, a neurotoxin banned by the EPA in 2011.
