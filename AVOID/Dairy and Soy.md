# Milk

- **Casein and soy protein**: Casein, a protein found in most dairy and soy, can negatively impact the tight junctions in your gut (thus causing a leaky gut).

## Dangers of Posilac Hormone

Posilac, also known as recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone (rBGH), is a genetically engineered hormone injected into lactating cows to increase milk production. However, its use has been linked to several health risks and dangers.

- **Increased risk of mastitis**: Posilac has been found to increase the incidence of mastitis, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition for cows.
- **Lameness and reproductive complications**: The hormone has also been linked to an increased risk of lameness and reproductive complications in cows.
- **Contamination of milk with pus and antibiotics**: The use of Posilac has been found to lead to an increase in the levels of pus and antibiotics in milk, which can pose a risk to human health.
- **Increased levels of IGF-1**: Posilac has been found to increase the levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 (IGF-1) in milk, which has been linked to an increased risk of certain types of cancer, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer.
- **Health risks to humans**: The consumption of milk from Posilac-treated cows has been linked to an increased risk of certain health problems, including cancer and antibiotic resistance.

**Countries that have banned Posilac**

Due to the potential health risks associated with Posilac, several countries have banned its use, including:

- European Union
- Canada
- Japan
- Pakistan
- Australia
- New Zealand
- Argentina

**Controversy and debate**

The use of Posilac has been the subject of controversy and debate, with some arguing that it is safe for human consumption and others raising concerns about its potential health risks.
