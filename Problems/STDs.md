# common STDs

Several sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be present without any signs or symptoms. These include chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and human papillomavirus (HPV)

Chlamydia and gonorrhea are bacterial STIs that often do not cause symptoms, especially in women and when present at sites like the throat or rectum  Syphilis, a bacterial STI, can also be asymptomatic in its early stages  HPV, a viral STI, can cause warts in the anal and genital regions, but it may also be asymptomatic

The lack of symptoms does not mean that these infections are harmless. For instance, untreated chlamydia and gonorrhea can lead to serious complications such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, and infertility  Similarly, untreated syphilis can progress to more severe stages and cause significant health issues  HPV can increase the risk of developing cancers of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, or throat

Given the potential for asymptomatic transmission, regular testing is crucial for early detection and treatment

## STD Antibody Incubation Periods

- **Chlamydia**: Antibodies can typically be detected 7-21 days after exposure.
- **Gonorrhea**: Antibodies can usually be detected 1-14 days after exposure.
- **HIV**: The antigen/antibody test can detect HIV antibodies 18-45 days after exposure.
- **Herpes**: Antibodies can usually be detected around 3-6 weeks after exposure, with most infected individuals showing detectable antibodies by 16 weeks.
- **Syphilis**: Antibodies can typically be detected 3-6 weeks after exposure, though symptoms can appear anytime between 10 and 90 days.
- **Trichomoniasis**: Antibodies can usually be detected within 5 to 28 days after exposure.
- **Hepatitis B**: Antibodies can typically be detected 6-12 weeks after exposure.
- **Hepatitis C**: Antibodies can usually be detected 8-12 weeks after exposure.
- **HPV**: Antibodies can typically be detected within 3 weeks to a few months after exposure.
- **Mycoplasma genitalium**: Antibodies can usually be detected within 2-4 weeks after exposure.

## Chlamydia

Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can affect men. It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis and can be spread through unprotected oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has chlamydia

Most men with chlamydia do not experience any symptoms, but if symptoms do occur, they typically arise from complications such as urethritis or epididymitis Symptoms may include unusual discharge from the penis, pain while urinating, burning or itching around the testicles and penis, and a burning sensation in the urethra In some cases, chlamydia can cause pain and swelling in the testicles

Chlamydia can also affect other parts of the body that come into contact with semen or vaginal fluid, potentially causing rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding

If left untreated, chlamydia can lead to serious health problems, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can cause long-term pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy in women. In men, untreated chlamydia can rarely cause infertility by infecting the epididymis, the tube that carries sperm from the testicles

To diagnose chlamydia, healthcare providers may use a urine sample or a swab from the urethra, vagina, cervix, or anus. These samples are then sent to a lab to check for the bacteria that causes chlamydia

Chlamydia can be easily treated and cured with antibiotics, such as azithromycin or doxycycline It is important to complete the full course of antibiotics, even if symptoms disappear before the medication is finished, to prevent reinfection and ensure the infection is fully cleared

After treatment, it is important to avoid having sex for 7 days after a single dose of antibiotics, or until the completion of a 7-day course of antibiotics, to prevent spreading the infection to others

If you have symptoms of chlamydia or have a partner who has an STI, you should get tested for chlamydia. Regular testing is recommended for sexually active individuals, especially those under 25 or with multiple partners

## Gonorrhea

Gonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can affect both men and women, symptoms may include a burning sensation when urinating, a white, yellow, or green discharge from the penis, and sometimes painful or swollen testicles However, many men do not show any symptoms

If left untreated, gonorrhea can lead to serious health complications in men, such as epididymitis, a painful condition that can affect the tubes attached to the testicles and potentially lead to infertility In rare cases, untreated gonorrhea can also spread to the blood or joints, which can be life-threatening Additionally, untreated gonorrhea may increase the risk of contracting or transmitting HIV

Treatment for gonorrhea typically involves antibiotics, but it is important to complete the full course of medication and to avoid sexual contact until the infection is fully treated and all partners have been treated as well

## Herpes Blister vs Pimple

Herpes can appear as a cluster of itchy or painful blisters filled with fluid, which may be clear or yellow. These blisters can develop into sores that bleed or ooze a whitish fluid, and they typically last 7 to 10 days before healing without scarring In contrast, pimples are usually round, filled with pus, and do not blister or become ulcerated. They tend to clear up within a week without medical intervention

## Genital warts

Genital warts can appear as small, flesh-colored or gray bumps that may resemble pimples. They can be raised or flat and sometimes appear in clusters that resemble a cauliflower

To differentiate between a pimple, a herpes outbreak, or a genital wart, consider the following:

- Herpes sores are often very painful and worsen with irritation, while pimples are only painful if touched
- Herpes outbreaks can cause localized groin lymph node enlargement, which is not typically associated with pimples
- Genital warts are usually painless and can appear in clusters or individually
- Pimples caused by shaving or irritation are often isolated and can be prevented by changing shaving habits or using different products
