# indoor plants, each targeting different air pollutants

NASA has classified Sansevieria, now called Dracaena, as an air purifier due to its ability to remove toxic compounds such as benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, xylene and toluene.
This plant uses the acid metabolism of the Crassulaceae to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, enabling it to resist drought.
The microscopic pores on its leaves, called stomata, open only at night to limit water loss through transpiration in the heat of the sun. Unlike other plants, Sansevieria produces oxygen and absorbs carbon dioxide at night, making it an excellent indoor air purifier while we sleep.

## air quality improver

to maximize the range of particles removed from your indoor air
Here are some of the best indoor plants for improving air quality:

- **Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata)**
  ‌
  - Easy to care for, thrives on neglect.
  - Tolerates low light and infrequent watering.
  - Effective at removing formaldehyde, benzene, toluene, and xylene from the air.
- **Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum)**
  ‌
  - Very easy to care for, adaptable to various light conditions (including low light).
  - Fast-growing vine.
  - Removes formaldehyde, xylene, and benzene from the air.
- **Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum)**
  ‌
  - Easy to care for, adaptable to various light conditions.
  - Produces baby spiderettes that can be propagated into new plants.
  - Effective at removing formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and xylene from the air.
- **Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii)**
  ‌
  - Easy to care for, prefers medium to low light.
  - Known to improve humidity levels.
  - Effective at removing formaldehyde, benzene, ammonia, trichloroethylene, and xylene from the air. Also helps to filter out mold spores.
- **Aloe Vera**
  ‌
  - Easy to care for, prefers bright, indirect sunlight.
  - The gel from the leaves can be used to soothe sunburns and minor skin irritations.
  - Effective at removing formaldehyde and benzene from the air.

These are just a few examples, there are many other houseplants that can help improve indoor air quality. Remember that no single plant will completely purify your air, but having a variety of plants in your home can make a significant difference.

| **Plant | Mature Height | Targets** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Snake Plant (Sansevieria trifasciata) | 8-12 inches | Benzene, formaldehyde, toluene, xylene |
| Golden Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) | Up to 6 ft (trailing vine) | Formaldehyde, xylene, benzene |
| Spider Plant (Chlorophytum comosum) | Up to 24 inches | Formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, xylene |
| Peace Lily (Spathiphyllum wallisii) | 12-16 inches | Formaldehyde, benzene, ammonia, trichloroethylene, xylene, mold spores |
| Dracaena Marginata (Madagascar Dragon Tree) | Up to 8 ft | Benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene |
| Ficus Benjamina (Weeping Fig) | Up to 10 ft | Formaldehyde, xylene, benzene |
| Boston Fern (Nephrolepis exaltata) | Up to 3 ft | Formaldehyde, xylene, toluene |
| Chinese Evergreen (Aglaonema) | Up to 2 ft | Formaldehyde, benzene, ammonia |
| Red-edged Dracaena (Dracaena Marginata) | Up to 8 ft | Benzene, trichloroethylene, xylene, toluene |
| Aloe Vera | Up to 2 ft | Formaldehyde, benzene |

**Additional Notes:**

- **Ammonia:** Several plants remove ammonia, but the Peace Lily is particularly effective.
- **Trichloroethylene:** Snake Plant and Dracaena Marginata are good choices for targeting this pollutant.
- **Carbon Monoxide:** While not as common an indoor pollutant, the Spider Plant helps remove it.

**Tips:**

- Group plants together to create a mini indoor "filter."
- Consider the light conditions in your home when choosing plants.
- Rotate your plants periodically to expose them to different light sources and promote even growth.

**Remember:** While houseplants can help improve indoor air quality, they are not a substitute for proper ventilation.
