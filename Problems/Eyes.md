# Eyes

## AVOID

- **Alcohol:** Excessive alcohol consumption can damage the optic nerve

## Foods to eat

**Nuts and seeds:** Nuts and seeds are a good source of vitamin E, an antioxidant that may help protect the eyes from age-related damage.


## MYOPIA

Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a common condition that affects millions of people worldwide. While there is no definitive "cure" for myopia, there are natural methods that can help slow its progression and improve overall eye health. Here are some evidence-based tips:

**1. Diet and Nutrition**

- Include foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as tuna, salmon, and walnuts, to reduce inflammation and promote healthy eye tissue.
- Consume leafy greens, vegetables, and fruits to provide essential vitamins and minerals, like vitamin A, vitamin C, and lutein.
- Avoid high-glycemic load carbohydrates, which may contribute to myopia progression.

**2. Lifestyle Changes**

- Reduce screen time and take regular breaks (every 20 minutes) to focus on distant objects and reduce eye strain.
- Engage in outdoor activities, such as reading or playing games, to reduce the risk of myopia development.
- Maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise to reduce the risk of obesity-related eye diseases.

**3. Visual Habits**

- Practice good reading habits, such as using proper lighting and adjusting font sizes, to reduce eye strain.
- Avoid reading or using electronic devices in low light conditions.
- Take regular breaks from near work to focus on distant objects and reduce eye fatigue.

**4. Sleep and Relaxation**

- Prioritize adequate sleep (7-9 hours) to reduce eye strain and promote overall eye health.
- Practice relaxation techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, to manage stress and reduce eye tension.

**5. Atropine Therapy**

- Low-dose atropine eye drops have been shown to slow myopia progression in some studies. However, this method should only be used under the guidance of an eye care professional.

**6. Eye Exercises**

- While there is limited scientific evidence supporting the effectiveness of eye exercises in improving myopia, some studies suggest that certain exercises may help reduce eye strain and improve visual acuity.

**Additional Tips**

- Get regular eye exams to monitor myopia progression and address any underlying eye health issues.
- Consider consulting with an eye care professional or optometrist for personalized advice on managing myopia.

Remember that myopia is a complex condition, and natural methods may not completely reverse its progression. However, by incorporating these evidence-based tips into your daily routine, you can help slow its progression and promote overall eye health.

## Glaucoma

IOP, a major risk factor for glaucoma, exhibits a complex relationship with age. While some studies suggest a decrease in IOP with age, others report an increase or no significant change.

**Cross-sectional analysis:**

- A study in Southern China found that IOP decreased significantly with age in men and women, except for the 65-69 birth cohort (Fig 2).
- In contrast, another study in South Korea reported no significant change in IOP with age.
- A study in Karachi, Pakistan, showed that mean IOP increased progressively with age until 60 years, with a significant increase between 41-50 and 51-60 years.

**Longitudinal analysis:**

- A 10-year longitudinal study in Japan found no significant change in IOP with age.
- Another study in South Korea reported a non-significant change in IOP with age.

**Corneal biomechanical properties and IOP:**

- Aging may affect corneal biomechanical properties, such as central corneal thickness (CCT) and corneal hysteresis, which can impact 24-hour IOP measurement.
- A study found that aging may lower corneal hysteresis and corneal resistance factor, but neither parameter shows a significant 24-hour variation.

**Ocular hypertension and aging:**

- Intraocular pressure slowly rises with increasing age, just as glaucoma becomes more prevalent as you get older.
- The risk of glaucomatous damage in people with ocular hypertension increases with higher IOP levels (21-25 mmHg, 26-30 mmHg, and >30 mmHg).
- Keeping pressures below 25 mmHg in people with ocular hypertension and older than 65 is often suggested.

In conclusion, the relationship between IOP and aging is complex and may vary depending on the population and study design. While some studies suggest a decrease in IOP with age, others report an increase or no significant change. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of aging on IOP and its implications for glaucoma risk assessment and management.

## Arcus senilis, also known as corneal arcus

a harmless condition characterized by lipid deposits that form a ring or arc around the cornea, the clear outer layer of the eye. It is a common finding in older adults, often associated with aging and high cholesterol levels.

**Causes:**

1. **Aging**: Arcus senilis is a natural consequence of aging, as the cornea's lipid metabolism changes over time.
2. **High cholesterol**: Elevated cholesterol levels in the blood can contribute to lipid deposits in the cornea.
3. **Genetic factors**: Familial hyperlipidemia, a genetic condition, can cause arcus senilis to develop at a younger age.

### Arcus Senilis: Overview

**Arcus senilis** is a condition characterized by a gray or white arc that appears around the cornea of the eye. It is caused by the accumulation of cholesterol deposits in the outer edge of the cornea. While typically benign and more common in older adults, it can indicate underlying health issues, especially elevated cholesterol levels.

### Causes

- **Aging**: The most common cause, as the condition is often seen in people over 50.
- **High Cholesterol**: May signal hyperlipidemia or other lipid metabolism disorders.
- **Genetics**: Family history can play a role in its development.

### Natural Remedies and Lifestyle Adjustments

While there is no direct cure for arcus senilis, certain lifestyle and dietary changes can help improve overall eye health and potentially address underlying issues:

#### 1. **Dietary Adjustments**

- **Increase Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Foods like fatty fish (salmon, mackerel), flaxseeds, and walnuts can support heart and eye health.
- **Fruits and Vegetables**: Aim for a diet rich in antioxidants, particularly leafy greens (spinach, kale) and brightly colored fruits (berries, oranges) to combat oxidative stress.
- **Limit Saturated Fats and Trans Fats**: Reduce intake of processed foods, fried foods, and fatty cuts of meat to help manage cholesterol levels.
- **Increase Fiber Intake**: Whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables can help lower cholesterol.
- **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to maintain eye moisture and overall health.

#### 2. **Regular Exercise**

- **Cardiovascular Exercise**: Activities like walking, running, swimming, or cycling can help improve circulation and reduce cholesterol levels.
- **Strength Training**: Incorporating resistance exercises can also contribute to overall health.

#### 3. **Avoid Smoking and Limit Alcohol**

- **Quit Smoking**: Smoking can contribute to various eye conditions and overall health deterioration.
- **Limit Alcohol Consumption**: Excessive alcohol can lead to health issues, including increased cholesterol levels.

#### 4. **Regular Eye Check-ups**

- **Routine Exams**: Regular visits to an eye care professional can help monitor eye health and any potential changes.

#### 5. **Manage Stress**

- **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing can help reduce stress, which can indirectly benefit overall health.

### Conclusion

While arcus senilis itself may not require treatment, making these lifestyle and dietary adjustments can improve overall eye health and help manage cholesterol levels. If you're concerned about arcus senilis or your cholesterol levels, consulting a healthcare professional is advisable for personalized advice and potential interventions.

## Stye and Chalazion: Overview

**Stye** and **chalazion** are both common eyelid conditions that can cause discomfort and irritation. While they may look similar, they have different causes and characteristics.

### Stye (Hordeolum)

- **Description**: A stye is a red, painful lump that forms on the edge of the eyelid, typically caused by a bacterial infection of the oil glands or hair follicles.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Redness and swelling
  - Tenderness or pain
  - Possible discharge
  - Sensitivity to light
- Caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection of the eyelid's oil gland or eyelash follicle
- Typically painful and swollen, with a pus-filled abscess
- May require drainage by a doctor if it doesn't resolve with warm compresses
- Home treatment involves applying warm compresses to encourage the stye to rupture and drain naturally

### Chalazion

- **Description**: A chalazion is a painless lump that forms within the eyelid due to a blocked oil gland. It can develop after a stye.
- **Symptoms**:
  - Swelling in the eyelid
  - Firm, round bump
  - Generally painless, but can become tender if inflamed
- Caused by obstruction of the oil gland's opening, leading to inflammation and swelling
- Not infected, unlike styes, and typically painless
- May be caused by staphylococcal infection, although it's not always the case
- Treatment may involve draining the fluid through a small incision or injecting steroids to reduce swelling and inflammation

**Shared Factors:**

- Both styes and chalazia can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria
- Good hygiene and avoiding sharing makeup or makeup brushes can help prevent staphylococcal infections
- Warm compresses can be used to treat both styes and chalazia, although styes may require drainage by a doctor

**Key Differences:**

- Pain: Styes are typically painful, while chalazia are usually painless
- Infection: Styes are infected, while chalazia are not
- Appearance: Styes are characterized by a pus-filled abscess, while chalazia appear as a firm, painless nodule

It's essential to note that while staphylococcal bacteria are often involved, not all styes and chalazia are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Other factors, such as meibomian gland obstruction, can also contribute to the development of chalazia. If you're experiencing symptoms, it's best to consult an eye care professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

### Natural Remedies to Resolve Stye and Chalazion

Although styes and chalazia often resolve on their own, natural methods can help alleviate symptoms and promote healing.

#### 1. **Warm Compress**

- **How to Use**: Soak a clean cloth in warm water, wring it out, and apply it to the affected eyelid for 10-15 minutes, 3-4 times a day.
- **Benefits**: Helps to soften the blockage, reduce swelling, and relieve discomfort.

#### 2. **Good Hygiene**

- **Practice**: Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes. Clean your eyelids gently with mild soap and water.
- **Benefits**: Reduces the risk of infection and promotes healing.

#### 3. **Tea Bags**

- **How to Use**: Use a warm, moist tea bag (black or green tea) as a compress for 10-15 minutes.
- **Benefits**: The tannins in tea can help reduce inflammation and fight bacteria.

#### 4. **Castor Oil**

- **How to Use**: Apply a drop of castor oil to the affected area using a clean cotton swab.
- **Benefits**: Castor oil has anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce swelling and promote healing.

#### 5. **Aloe Vera**

- **How to Use**: Apply a small amount of fresh aloe vera gel to the affected eyelid.
- **Benefits**: Aloe vera has soothing and anti-inflammatory properties.

#### 6. **Avoid Makeup and Contact Lenses**

- **Recommendation**: Refrain from using eye makeup and contact lenses until the stye or chalazion has healed.
- **Benefits**: Prevents further irritation and reduces the risk of worsening the condition.

#### 7. **Maintain a Healthy Diet**

- **Focus On**: Include anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, and fish rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
- **Benefits**: Support your immune system and overall health.

### When to See a Doctor

If symptoms persist for more than a few days, if the stye or chalazion becomes increasingly painful or swollen, or if you experience vision changes, it's important to consult a healthcare professional. They may recommend further treatment, such as prescription medication or drainage for severe cases.

## contact lens

### BC (Base Curve)

The BC (Base Curve) measurement in a contact lens prescription refers to the curvature of the contact lens. It is a critical aspect in determining the proper fit of the lens on the eye. Here's a breakdown of the BC measurement:

- **Measurement unit**: BC is typically measured in millimeters (mm).
- **Description**: The BC measurement indicates the degree of curvature or steepness of the contact lens. A higher BC value corresponds to a more curved lens, while a lower BC value represents a flatter lens.
- **Correlation with eye shape**: The BC measurement is matched to the natural curvature of the cornea (the dome-shaped surface at the front of the eye). A well-matched BC ensures a comfortable and effective fit, allowing the lens to sit properly on the eye.
- **Importance**: A proper BC measurement is essential for:
  - Comfort: A lens that doesn't fit correctly can cause discomfort, dryness, or irritation.
  - Vision: An improperly fitted lens can affect visual acuity or cause blurry vision.
  - Preventing complications**: A mismatched BC can lead to issues like lens displacement, corneal irritation, or even eye infections.

In summary, the BC measurement in a contact lens prescription is a critical parameter that ensures a comfortable and effective fit between the lens and the eye's natural curvature. It is essential to ensure that the BC measurement matches the prescription to achieve optimal contact lens wear.

### Eyeglass Prescription Elements

- **OD**: Oculus Dexter, referring to the right eye.
- **OS**: Oculus Sinister, referring to the left eye.

### Cylinder and Axis

- **CYL**: Cylinder power, indicating the lens power needed to correct astigmatism.
- **Axis**: An angle value between 0 and 180, determining the orientation of the cylinder correction for astigmatism.

## Cataracts

### Ayurvedic plants for cataracts

Sananga is a plant extract derived from the bark of the Tabernaemontana undulata shrub, native to the Amazon rainforest.

It has been used for centuries by indigenous tribes in the Amazon for a variety of purposes, including:

- Enhancing vision: Traditionally, sananga was used as eye drops to improve visual acuity and depth perception. This is likely due to the presence of iboga alkaloids in the plant, which have stimulant properties. However, there is no scientific evidence to support these claims.
- Treating eye infections: The Ticuna tribe, for example, is reported to use the latex from a closely related Tabernaemontana species to treat eye wounds.
- Promoting vivid dreams: Some users report that sananga can induce vivid or lucid dreaming.

It is important to note that sananga can have a number of side effects, including:

- Severe stinging and burning in the eyes
- Increased heart rate and blood pressure
- Nausea and vomiting
- Dizziness and lightheadedness

Sananga is a powerful substance and should only be used under the guidance of a qualified healthcare professional. There is limited scientific research on the safety and efficacy of sananga, so it is important to be aware of the potential risks before using it.

- **Triphala**: A combination of three herbs (Amalaki, Haritaki, and Bibhitaki) that has been shown to delay the onset and progression of cataracts in animal studies.
- **Cinnamomum verum**: The bark of this plant has been found to inhibit the formation of advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs), which are thought to contribute to the development of cataracts.
- **Pueraria montana**: The extract of this plant has been shown to inhibit the formation of AGEs and prevent the oxidation of lens proteins, which can contribute to cataract formation.
- **Ludwigia hyssopifolia**: The juice of this plant has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat cataracts, and has been shown to inhibit the formation of AGEs and prevent the oxidation of lens proteins.
- **Marchantia polymorpha**: The extract of this plant has been found to inhibit the formation of AGEs and prevent the oxidation of lens proteins.
- **Oxalis rosea**: The juice of this plant has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat cataracts, and has been shown to inhibit the formation of AGEs and prevent the oxidation of lens proteins.
- **Tridax procumbens**: The extract of this plant has been found to inhibit the formation of AGEs and prevent the oxidation of lens proteins.
- **Emblica officinalis**: The fruit of this plant has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat cataracts, and has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help prevent cataract formation.
- **Vaccinium myrtillus**: The fruit of this plant has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat cataracts, and has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help prevent cataract formation.
- **Terminalia chebula**: The fruit of this plant has been traditionally used in Ayurvedic medicine to treat cataracts, and has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may help prevent cataract formation.

It is important to note that while these plants may have potential benefits for preventing or treating cataracts, more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and to determine their optimal dosages and preparation methods. Additionally, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or are taking medications.

Ayurvedic herbs can be used to prevent or treat other eye conditions, such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration. According to the search results, Ayurvedic treatment for glaucoma reduces increased eye pressure and strengthens nerves to prevent further decreases in vision. The Ayurvedic eye drops for glaucoma and medicines work alongside therapies to strengthen the optic nerve and stop its degeneration. Additionally, Ginkgo Biloba is an Ayurvedic herb that stabilizes the capillaries in the eye to make them less fragile, which can help in glaucoma treatment.

## green tea

Furthermore, green tea, which is rich in flavonoids, has been found to help manage diseases such as cataracts, macular degeneration, and certain types of glaucoma. The flavonoids in green tea collect in the retina and protect eyes against harmful ultraviolet radiations, acting as a natural “sunscreen” for the eyes.
It is essential to note that while these Ayurvedic herbs may have potential benefits for preventing or treating eye conditions, more research is needed to confirm their effectiveness and to determine their optimal dosages and preparation methods. Additionally, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before using any herbal remedies, especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition or are taking medications.

## TOP 7 HERBS FOR EYE HEALTH

### 1. BILBERRY

Bilberry stands out among other remedies used for eyesight in ayurvedic medicine because it improves both normal vision and night vision.
It is one of the best options indicated for people with eye problems as it contains substances called anthocyanosides, which makes it effective for night vision and low light handicap.
Bilberry also decreases vascular permeability and capillary fragility. Legend has it that British fighter pilots had their nighttime vision improved during World War II because they used to eat bilberry jam.
Animal studies have even shown that bilberry has protective roles against cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration.  

### 2. GINKGO BILOBA

Ginkgo Biloba is a well-established natural remedy for eyesight. It has been known to protect people from eye conditions such as glaucoma and macular degeneration.
 Taking ginkgo extract orally can sometimes improve pre-existing damage to the visual field related to glaucoma. However, there is conflicting research on its mechanism of action and how long you should take it before it’s effective.
Some studies suggest that ginkgo extract isn’t very effective for the progression of glaucoma when it is taken for a month or less. People have seen improvement, however, when they supplement with ginkgo biloba extract long term.
Ginkgo can also be used as a remedy for vision problems in people with diabetes mellitus. Diabetes often causes retinopathy – a condition where the retina becomes so damaged that the affected individual loses color vision.
Taking ginkgo orally for about 6 months may help improve color vision in people with diabetes.
So how exactly does it work?
Well, the development of opacities in the eyes is associated with the death of human lens epithelial cells. High blood glucose (like that in diabetes) is usually the initiating agent of this process.
Ginkgo biloba actively inhibits this process, though it is still unclear exactly how.
Other than that, ginkgo also boosts blood circulation to the eye.

###  3. PASSION FLOWER

Passion flower is another beneficial product that contributes significantly to the management of eyesight conditions in Ayurvedic medicine.
Its mechanism of action is straightforward and simple: It relaxes the blood vessels in your eyes, which helps you see better.
Besides relaxing the blood vessels, passion flower is also a potent nerve relaxer. By reducing the tension in the nerves of the eye, it improves the ability of the eyes to focus clearly and accommodate images irrespective of their distances.
Passion flower also reduces and heals strain in the eyes that occur when its muscles are overused.

### 4. EYEBRIGHT

Eyebright is a plant whose shoot (the parts above the ground) is used to make medicine. Eyebright works to moisturize, cleanse, brighten and maintain overall eye health.
It also helps reduce eye strain and acts as a soothing agent for irritated eyes.There are quite a number of conditions that can be treated with eyebright.
Some of these conditions include:

- conjunctivitis
- blepharitis
- eye fatigue
- inflammation involving the vessels of the eye
Eyebright is also among the most effective natural remedies for dry, red or weeping eyes.

### 5. CALENDULA

Though known for a number of uses in the herbal remedy sphere, calendula is surprisingly effective in managing eye issues. Also known pot marigold, calendula has antibacterial, antiviral and powerful anti-inflammatory properties. It can be used to manage eye conditions such as:

- conjunctivitis
- allergies
- Genearl eye irritations
- minor eye injuries
- redness or swelling of the eyes

### 6. GREEN TEA

Green tea really delivers when it comes to disease prevention and health benefits - all thanks to its antioxidant properties. Green tea contains the following antioxidant constituents:

- vitamin C
- lutein
- flavonoids
- zeaxanthin

## lutein and zeaxanthin

antioxidants that protect the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision. Examples include kale, spinach, collard greens, and broccoli.

All of which are potent protectors against eye disease, cancer and even heart disease.
The flavonoids in green tea help manage diseases such as cataracts, macular degeneration and certain types of glaucoma.
One flavonoid called gallocatechin actually collects in the retina and protects eyes against harmful ultraviolet radiations. You can think of it like “sunscreen” for the eyes.
Several ophthalmology studies have been conducted on green tea, showing that different parts of the eye absorb differing amounts of gallocatechin.
Their findings show that the retina absorbs it most liberally, while the cornea absorbs the least amount.
Animal studies also reveal that drinking green tea protects your eyes for up to 20 hours after consumption.

###  7. ROOIBOS (ASPHALATUS)

Rooibos is mostly grown in the shrublands of South Africa as the winter rain falls. Like green tea, rooibos also contains antioxidants that are beneficial for healthy eyesight.
Also known as asphalatus, it is rich in nutrients like calcium, iron, zinc and magnesium.
It also contains anti-inflammatory properties, which help reduce puffiness around the eyes while calming and soothing eye irritation.

The Ayurvedic medicine for eyesight improvement tips discussed today provide a natural way to not only support eye health but to help prevent degenerative eye conditions from occurring in the first place.
As with most natural remedies, herbs for vision should be taken long term in most cases as it is not an overnight fix, so plan accordingly.
Also, keep in mind that such remedies are best used when taking a preventive approach to your eye health, though they can be incredibly effective if certain eye conditions already exist.
If you want to improve your eyesight as naturally as possible while supporting overall ocular health, consider a quality tincture that combines the vision-boosting herbs mentioned above.
