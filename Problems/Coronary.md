## Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a medical condition characterized by the formation of blood clots in the deep veins, typically in the legs. These clots can break off and travel to the lungs, causing a potentially life-threatening condition known as pulmonary embolism (PE)

Current diagnostic methods for DVT include venography, which uses a contrast agent and an external transducer to observe blood flow. Venography is widely used and has high accuracy, but it is invasive, costly, and carries risks such as allergy, renal dysfunction, and morbidity. It can also be inaccurate in detecting low limb thrombosis and may be difficult to access in obese individuals or those with edema or cellulitis

Nanotechnology is advancing the field of DVT diagnosis and treatment. For example, abciximab conjugated phospholipid microbubbles can be used for molecular imaging of clots by binding specifically to platelets. This method offers targeted contrast administration and can enhance the detection of clots[51, 52].

Additionally, researchers are exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to improve the diagnosis of DVT. A study published in Advance Healthcare Materials by Scott Medina and colleagues at Penn State describes a technology capable of localizing and imaging blood clots in deep veins. This technology may also be able to treat DVT, addressing the need for rapid detection, monitoring, and treatment of the condition[14].

Another approach involves the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to evaluate the quality of light reflection rheography (LRR) signals and classify positive or negative DVT from these signals with high reliability

These advancements in biomedical science and technology are aimed at improving the accuracy, efficiency, and safety of diagnosing and treating DVT.
